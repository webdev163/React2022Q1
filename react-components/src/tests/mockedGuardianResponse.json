In all those cases the type of establishment evolved in line with the unique cultural and societal characteristics of those countries. The concept of a “social gathering place with food and drink for local residents” is not unique to the British Isles, but the specific characteristics of those establishments are obviously going to reflect the local conditions (pubs with large fireplaces for the cold climate, for example, or bars designed to cater to industrial workers who wanted some social interaction at the end of their long shifts). <strong>pipspeak</strong></p> <p>I’m Dutch and I might as well ask why there aren’t any proper <em>bruine kroegen </em>(brown cafes) anywhere else in the world.

They generate a sense of place and provide a “neutral ground”, which is characterised by intimacy and cosiness, but which could be attributed neither entirely to the sphere of the state nor to the sphere of the economy, neither to private life nor to the public, but which mediated between the respective spheres and thus has a socially balancing effect. Understood in this way, third places can be found in many societies – in my home town of Vienna, the coffee house would be one such place.

          "body": "<p>As America slouches toward the midterm elections, you need an economic message that celebrates your accomplishments to date – job creation and higher wages – yet also takes aim at the major abuses of economic power that remain in the system, fueling inflation and widening inequality.</p> <p>You should put these 10 indisputable facts center stage:</p> <p>1. Corporate profits are at a <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/corporate-profits\">70-year high</a>. Yet corporations are raising their prices.</p> <p>2. They are not raising prices because of the increasing costs of supplies and components and of labor – which are real but expected when an economy goes suddenly from a pandemically induced deep freeze due to meeting the soaring demands of consumers who are emerging from the pandemic. Corporations enjoying record profits in a healthy competitive economy would absorb these costs.</p> <p>3. Instead, they’re passing these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In many cases they’re raising prices higher than those cost increases, using the cover of inflation to increase their profit margins even more.</p> <p>4. They’re doing so because they face little or no competition. If markets were competitive, companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. As the White House National Economic Council put it in a December <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/12/10/recent-data-show-dominant-meat-processing-companies-are-taking-advantage-of-market-power-to-raise-prices-and-grow-profit-margins/\">report</a>: “Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t [maintain high profit margins and pass on higher costs to consumers], because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.”</p> <p>5. Since the 1980s, two-thirds of all American industries have become <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">more concentrated</a>. This concentration gives corporations the power to raise prices because it makes it easy for them to informally coordinate price increases with the handful of other companies in their same industry – without risking the possibility of losing customers, who have no other choice.</p> <p>6. Corporations are using these near-record profits to boost share prices by buying back a record amount of their own shares of stock. (Buybacks reduce a company’s shares outstanding, pushing its profit-per-share figure higher.) Stock buybacks hit a new record last year. So far this year they’re on track to exceed that record. In the first two months of 2022, S&amp;P 500 companies have disclosed authorizations to buy back $238bn in stock – a <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stock-buybacks-at-record-pace-for-2022\">record pace</a>, according to Goldman Sachs, which expects <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stock-buybacks-at-record-pace-for-2022\">$1tn</a> of buybacks this year – an all-time high.</p> <p>Chevron engaged in $1.4bn in stock buybacks and spent $500m more on shareholder dividends than it did in 2020. This year, the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more.</p> <p>7. Most American workers have barely had a wage increase in 40 years (adjusted for inflation). Although corporations have recently given out wage increases in response to the post-pandemic surge in demand, these wage increases have been almost completely eroded by price increases.</p> <p>Corporations are handing out wage increases to attract or keep workers with one hand, and then eliminating those wage increases by raising prices with the other. When corporations are enjoying near-record profits, we would expect corporations to pay the higher wages out of their profits rather than to pass them on to consumers in higher prices. But they are not. The labor market is not “unhealthily” tight, as Jerome Powell asserts; corporations are unhealthily fat. Workers do not have too much power; corporations do.</p> <p>8. As a result of all this, income and wealth are being redistributed upward from average working people (many of whom live from paycheck to paycheck) to CEOs and shareholders, including the wealthiest people in America. Billionaires have become <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/22068/change-in-wealth-of-billionaires-during-pandemic/\">$1.7tn richer during the pandemic</a>. CEO pay (based largely on stock values) is now at a record <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2020/\">350 to 1 ratio</a> relative to median pay.</p> <p>9. Wealthy Americas are now paying a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/forbes-400-pay-lower-tax-rates-many-ordinary-americans/\">lower tax rate than the working class</a>. Some are paying no taxes at all.</p> <p>10. Big corporations have accumulated a substantial amount of political power, with which they’ve beaten back lower drug prices, prevented higher corporate taxes, and amassed unprecedented corporate welfare.</p> <p>In short, although the American economy is rebounding nicely from recession, the growing imbalance of economic power is bad for most Americans and for the economy as a whole. It must be addressed through (a) tougher antitrust enforcement, (b) a temporary windfall profits tax, (c) higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, (d) a ban on corporate buybacks, (e) stronger unions, and (f) campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics.</p> <p>You have a critical opportunity to reframe the national conversation as it should be framed – around these worsening abuses of economic power by large corporations and the super-rich.

          "bodyText": "As America slouches toward the midterm elections, you need an economic message that celebrates your accomplishments to date – job creation and higher wages – yet also takes aim at the major abuses of economic power that remain in the system, fueling inflation and widening inequality. You should put these 10 indisputable facts center stage: 1. Corporate profits are at a 70-year high. Yet corporations are raising their prices. 2. They are not raising prices because of the increasing costs of supplies and components and of labor – which are real but expected when an economy goes suddenly from a pandemically induced deep freeze due to meeting the soaring demands of consumers who are emerging from the pandemic. Corporations enjoying record profits in a healthy competitive economy would absorb these costs. 3. Instead, they’re passing these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In many cases they’re raising prices higher than those cost increases, using the cover of inflation to increase their profit margins even more. 4. They’re doing so because they face little or no competition. If markets were competitive, companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. As the White House National Economic Council put it in a December report: “Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t [maintain high profit margins and pass on higher costs to consumers], because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.” 5. Since the 1980s, two-thirds of all American industries have become more concentrated. This concentration gives corporations the power to raise prices because it makes it easy for them to informally coordinate price increases with the handful of other companies in their same industry – without risking the possibility of losing customers, who have no other choice. 6. Corporations are using these near-record profits to boost share prices by buying back a record amount of their own shares of stock. (Buybacks reduce a company’s shares outstanding, pushing its profit-per-share figure higher.) Stock buybacks hit a new record last year. So far this year they’re on track to exceed that record. In the first two months of 2022, S&amp;P 500 companies have disclosed authorizations to buy back $238bn in stock – a record pace, according to Goldman Sachs, which expects $1tn of buybacks this year – an all-time high. Chevron engaged in $1.4bn in stock buybacks and spent $500m more on shareholder dividends than it did in 2020. This year, the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more. 7. Most American workers have barely had a wage increase in 40 years (adjusted for inflation). Although corporations have recently given out wage increases in response to the post-pandemic surge in demand, these wage increases have been almost completely eroded by price increases. Corporations are handing out wage increases to attract or keep workers with one hand, and then eliminating those wage increases by raising prices with the other. When corporations are enjoying near-record profits, we would expect corporations to pay the higher wages out of their profits rather than to pass them on to consumers in higher prices. But they are not. The labor market is not “unhealthily” tight, as Jerome Powell asserts; corporations are unhealthily fat. Workers do not have too much power; corporations do. 8. As a result of all this, income and wealth are being redistributed upward from average working people (many of whom live from paycheck to paycheck) to CEOs and shareholders, including the wealthiest people in America. Billionaires have become $1.7tn richer during the pandemic. CEO pay (based largely on stock values) is now at a record 350 to 1 ratio relative to median pay. 9. Wealthy Americas are now paying a lower tax rate than the working class. Some are paying no taxes at all. 10. Big corporations have accumulated a substantial amount of political power, with which they’ve beaten back lower drug prices, prevented higher corporate taxes, and amassed unprecedented corporate welfare. In short, although the American economy is rebounding nicely from recession, the growing imbalance of economic power is bad for most Americans and for the economy as a whole. It must be addressed through (a) tougher antitrust enforcement, (b) a temporary windfall profits tax, (c) higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, (d) a ban on corporate buybacks, (e) stronger unions, and (f) campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics. You have a critical opportunity to reframe the national conversation as it should be framed – around these worsening abuses of economic power by large corporations and the super-rich. Republicans have left themselves vulnerable because they have no response to this. They believe their “culture wars” will distract the public from what’s going on. This is not and should not be a partisan issue. Average working Americans – many of whom voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 – are being shafted.

Friends of Sunak were quoted anonymously in the media as saying No 10 was briefing against Sunak because he had been distinctly unsupportive of Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/has-rishi-sunak-blown-chance-tory-leader\" title=\"\">during Partygate</a> when a leadership contest seemed on the cards.</p> <p>The implication of Sunak’s <em>Sun</em> interview was that because his wife had acted within the law and it was her money, it was no one else’s business and nothing would change.</p> <p>But that evening – as it was also emerging that Sunak had held a US green card for 19 months of his time as chancellor and six years as an MP (meaning he had declared himself as a permanent US resident for tax purposes during that period) – Murty issued a statement.</p> <p>She announced she would pay UK taxes on her overseas income after all, not because she had to, but because she wanted to and because she recognised that not doing so was contrary to the “British sense of fairness”.</p> <p>She would, however, remain a non dom, meaning she would still be able to take advantage of rules that could permit her in future to avoid inheritance tax of more than £275m.</p> <p>If Murty and the chancellor think her change of mind will be the end of the controversy and restore his fortunes quickly, senior figures in the Conservative party are not convinced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66e85e512cdf335b4bbf4230c54f9b8f7321f3ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66e85e512cdf335b4bbf4230c54f9b8f7321f3ea/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme is now seen as a mistake that helped spread Covid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one former Tory cabinet minister put it, the whole episode had raised questions not so much about their wealth or tax arrangements, but about Sunak’s political savvy.</p> <p>“It is not so much about money, though that is difficult, it is the matter of judgment. That is what colleagues are concerned about, what it says about his judgment. I would say he is certainly damaged.”</p> <p>How was it that someone who wanted to run the country could have allowed his personal affairs and those of his wife to be arranged in a way that one day would, inevitably, come to light?</p> <p>Another Tory MP said that what would worry colleagues with small majorities most was that both the prime minister and chancellor had now lost their shine, and both were under clouds at a time of severe economic difficulty for the country.</p> <p>Sunak’s mishaps and misjudgments had sowed seeds of doubts even before the non-dom furore. While he was credited with introducing the hugely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/oct/12/budget-sunak-jobs-market-covid\" title=\"\">costly furlough scheme </a>early on in the pandemic, which cost a total of around £70bn, “eat out to help out” was seen as a big error in the fight against Covid that encouraged people to socialise before it was really safe to do so.</p> <p>Several of his small PR stunts have backfired since, often because they raised the subject of his wealth. In a pre-budget photo opportunity in July 2020 he was photographed with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/07/rishi-sunak-prepares-for-mini-budget-with-help-of-180-smart-mug\" title=\"\">“smart mug” costing £180</a>. Then to coincide with last month’s spring statement in which he cut fuel duty he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/25/pool-sliders-charm-bracelets-kia-rio-tories-brand-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">photographed filling up a Kia Rio </a>only for it to be revealed that the car had been borrowed from a worker at the petrol station and that the Sunaks’ fleet of vehicles consisted of a top-of-the-range Range Rover, a BMW and a very smart Lexus.</p> <p>Shortly after the spring statement, as controversy raged about his refusal to do more for the poorest in the country, it was revealed that the Sunaks would be heading to their luxury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/sunaks-5m-santa-monica-flat-offers-sun-sea-and-a-pet-spa\" title=\"\">apartment in California</a> for an Easter break.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5ba6ada863dcdf1e66a38dd8e3a8f1e5ec10aeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ba6ada863dcdf1e66a38dd8e3a8f1e5ec10aeb/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mayor of Northallerton, Phil Eames\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Northallerton, Phil Eames, thinks the Sunaks’ tax arrangements are hypocritical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result of the past week, in particular, is that Sunak is now associated every bit as much with wealth – he himself set up a successful hedge fund before entering politics in which it is believed he may still retain a stake – as Boris Johnson is with lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street.</p> <p>The opposition parties now have a new, second target to aim at alongside Johnson – the chancellor who refuses to help those on benefits while protecting his own family’s wealth from the tax man. When parliament returns after the Easter break, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party will demand transparency over the chancellor’s personal finances at every turn.</p> <p>Back in his own constituency, while most people seem to be Sunak supporters, there are some who are beginning to turn and form the opinion that their MP like Johnson, practises “do as I say, not as I do” politics.</p> <p>One is Phil Eames, who is mayor of Northallerton. “I’m speaking personally, not in an official capacity,” said Eames, “but I think it’s disgusting, hypocritical and out-of-touch. It’s up to leaders to set an example.”</p> <p>There are others too. For Helen, who has a young child and has had to return to work to pay the bills, the point is that as a politician, you must carry the can and show responsible leadership, not feather your own nest.</p> <p>“What your family does reflects on you, whether that’s right or not. When you’re in that kind of position you take on that kind of responsibility,” she said.</p>",

Just four months ago, Sunak’s approval rating stood at a very healthy +11. Now, however, the worry for Conservative MPs – particularly those with small majorities – is that the shine has gone off not only the prime minister, but his chancellor. Talk of rifts between the two grow by the day, as Johnson pushes to spend more to get the economy moving and Sunak tries to rein him in. From the moment it was revealed, in the middle of last week, that Murty was a non dom and was therefore choosing not to pay UK tax on income from her shareholding – estimated to be worth £690m – in her father’s multibillion-pound Infosys business empire, most Conservative MPs could sense the position was unsustainable. Only two weeks before, Sunak had refused to lift benefits by the rate of inflation for millions in his widely criticised spring statement, meaning that from 11 April those receiving help from the state will suffer a reduction in their real-terms income that the Joseph Rowntree Trust says amounts to “the greatest fall in the value of the basic rate of unemployment benefit since 1972”. Writing on the Conservative Home website on Friday, the former Tory MP Paul Goodman warned the Sunaks that holding firm and then giving in to pressure would damage them most of all politically. “The very worst thing that can happen is to dig in and then have to give way and I wonder if that is what will happen here,” he wrote. Sunak had appeared in the Sun that morning in defiant mode, accusing those who criticised his wife of peddling “unpleasant smears”. “Rishi: Lay Off My Missus” was the front page headline. Friends of Sunak were quoted anonymously in the media as saying No 10 was briefing against Sunak because he had been distinctly unsupportive of Johnson during Partygate when a leadership contest seemed on the cards. The implication of Sunak’s Sun interview was that because his wife had acted within the law and it was her money, it was no one else’s business and nothing would change. But that evening – as it was also emerging that Sunak had held a US green card for 19 months of his time as chancellor and six years as an MP (meaning he had declared himself as a permanent US resident for tax purposes during that period) – Murty issued a statement. She announced she would pay UK taxes on her overseas income after all, not because she had to, but because she wanted to and because she recognised that not doing so was contrary to the “British sense of fairness”. She would, however, remain a non dom, meaning she would still be able to take advantage of rules that could permit her in future to avoid inheritance tax of more than £275m. If Murty and the chancellor think her change of mind will be the end of the controversy and restore his fortunes quickly, senior figures in the Conservative party are not convinced. As one former Tory cabinet minister put it, the whole episode had raised questions not so much about their wealth or tax arrangements, but about Sunak’s political savvy. “It is not so much about money, though that is difficult, it is the matter of judgment. That is what colleagues are concerned about, what it says about his judgment. I would say he is certainly damaged.” How was it that someone who wanted to run the country could have allowed his personal affairs and those of his wife to be arranged in a way that one day would, inevitably, come to light? Another Tory MP said that what would worry colleagues with small majorities most was that both the prime minister and chancellor had now lost their shine, and both were under clouds at a time of severe economic difficulty for the country. Sunak’s mishaps and misjudgments had sowed seeds of doubts even before the non-dom furore. While he was credited with introducing the hugely costly furlough scheme early on in the pandemic, which cost a total of around £70bn, “eat out to help out” was seen as a big error in the fight against Covid that encouraged people to socialise before it was really safe to do so. Several of his small PR stunts have backfired since, often because they raised the subject of his wealth. In a pre-budget photo opportunity in July 2020 he was photographed with a “smart mug” costing £180. Then to coincide with last month’s spring statement in which he cut fuel duty he was photographed filling up a Kia Rio only for it to be revealed that the car had been borrowed from a worker at the petrol station and that the Sunaks’ fleet of vehicles consisted of a top-of-the-range Range Rover, a BMW and a very smart Lexus. Shortly after the spring statement, as controversy raged about his refusal to do more for the poorest in the country, it was revealed that the Sunaks would be heading to their luxury apartment in California for an Easter break. The result of the past week, in particular, is that Sunak is now associated every bit as much with wealth – he himself set up a successful hedge fund before entering politics in which it is believed he may still retain a stake – as Boris Johnson is with lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street. The opposition parties now have a new, second target to aim at alongside Johnson – the chancellor who refuses to help those on benefits while protecting his own family’s wealth from the tax man. When parliament returns after the Easter break, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party will demand transparency over the chancellor’s personal finances at every turn. Back in his own constituency, while most people seem to be Sunak supporters, there are some who are beginning to turn and form the opinion that their MP like Johnson, practises “do as I say, not as I do” politics. One is Phil Eames, who is mayor of Northallerton. “I’m speaking personally, not in an official capacity,” said Eames, “but I think it’s disgusting, hypocritical and out-of-touch. It’s up to leaders to set an example.” There are others too. For Helen, who has a young child and has had to return to work to pay the bills, the point is that as a politician, you must carry the can and show responsible leadership, not feather your own nest. “What your family does reflects on you, whether that’s right or not. When you’re in that kind of position you take on that kind of responsibility,” she said.",

He’s since missed a birdie opportunity from ten feet on 3. He’s +3, and those career slam dreams look more and more fanciful as the years go by. On that subject, here’s Steve Buist: “It pains me to say this but I fear Rory has become a head case. I like the guy immensely but I predict he’ll never win another major. Something’s not loggin’ in his noggin. But he owes me nothing. Back in 2011, I was on a golf holiday to Scotland and popped in to a Coral’s in Troon and bet on Rory to win the US Open – when he was leading by 10 strokes or something like that. He held on and I won 86p. I think the Coral’s had to close after that payout.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6251bb718f081f653cd8c7c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-04-09T17:02:37.429Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here we go, then.

          "bodyText": "Scottie Scheffler’s lead was six at one point. Now it’s been cut to three, with Cameron Smith coming at him with a fine 68. What threatened to turn into a procession is now anything but. Scheffler is still strong favourite for the green jacket tomorrow, but history shows how quickly things can change at Augusta. Hey, the last couple of hours alone show that. Hope you’ll join us for the real start of the tournament, when Scheffler and Smith hit the turn on Sunday afternoon. Should be a cracker. Thanks for reading. Nighty night! -9: Scheffler -6: Smith -4: Im -2: Lowry, Schwartzel -1: Thomas, Conners E: Willett +1: Fleetwood, Kokrak, McIlroy, Morikawa, D Johnson +2: Champ, Simpson, Zalatoris, Matsuyama Scheffler tidies up for his bogey, and that sets the seal on a 71 that could have been better ... but could also have been a whole lot worse. Four bogeys coming back home, which will give him pause when he imagines the pressures of the back nine tomorrow ... but maybe the calm way in which he dealt with the drama on 18 and limited the damage will stand him in good stead. He’s been through the wringer, and has come out the other side with a three-stroke lead! He’s -9. Scheffler elects to putt up the bank and onto the green. There’s 40 feet between his ball and the hole. He taps it up carefully, the left-to-right swinger never looking like going in, but that’s not really the point. It’s all about damage limitation, and he’s left with a two-footer coming back for his bogey. Schwartzel takes his two putts for a one-over 73. He ends the day at -2. Back to Scheffler, who drops two club lengths away from where his ball nestled in the bush. Now it’s on the pine straw to the left of the fairway. He draws a long iron from his holster and whistles an amazing third towards the flag ... but over the back of the green. If he holes the chip coming back, it’ll be a par for the ages! While he goes about his business, Charl Schwartzel is asked to play on ... if he likes, that is. He does like. And he very much likes the sprinkler head that stops his ball falling down the bank to the left of the green. He’ll be able to putt from 25 feet. They’ve found Scheffler’s Titleist in the middle of a thicket. Scheffler calls for the rules official. Looks like he’s going to take an unplayable. Out comes the driver so he can measure two club lengths. While the officials look for Scheffler’s ball in the bushes down the left of 18 ... here’s something to while away the time. Charl Schwartzel can’t make his par putt, and that’s his fourth bogey in seven holes. Nothing’s gone his way since holing out from 130 yards on 10. The golfing gods have been paid back and then some. Scottie Scheffler rolls in his birdie putt, and the lead once again is four ... though he then sends a wild hook into the trees down the left of 18. He’ll be in the lap of the gods there, too. Did he use up his chunk of luck when he only just got over that bunker to set up his birdie on the last? -10: Scheffler (17) -6: Smith (F) -4: Im (F) -2: Lowry (F), Schwartzel (17) Charl Schwartzel leaves his 60-foot birdie putt across 17 well short. He’s got something to think about there. While he ponders it, Shane Lowry pars the last for a one-over 73; he’s -2 overall, and is rubbing his forehead in frustration. His partner Im Sung-jae splashes out of the sand on the right to three feet, and taps in for par. A 71, and it’s a round of two halves all right: 39 out, 32 back. He’s -4. Scheffler could be forgiven for rocking after a difficult run of holes. But having split the 17th fairway, he lands his approach on the shoulder of the bunker to the left of the green, allowing the topography to bring his ball around to five feet! Now then, that might have been a slight pull and a lucky bounce ... or it’s a work of genius, and this young man has hit enough amazing shots for one to suspect the latter. What a shot! Schwartzel meanwhile finds the heart of the green, a decent shot in and of itself, but in this context, six shots adrift, no good. The defending champion Hideki Matsuyama gets up and down from the left of 18 for par. Sadly it’s a 77. He never got going today. Neither did his partner Harold Varner III, who bogeys the last and shoots 80. They’re +2 and +6 respectively. Two putts from distance at 16 for Scheffler to secure his par. That turns up a little matchplay-style heat on Schwartzel, who isn’t able to make his ten-foot birdie putt. A chance to close the gap on the leader is gone ... and then he pulls a two-footer, the ball lipping out on the left. That gap between the pair widens. Meanwhile up on 17, Lowry can’t get up and down from the back, and continues chuntering away at his caddy, who is really earning his corn today. Lowry’s mood isn’t helped when Im rattles in a 15-footer for his fourth birdie of the back nine! -9: Scheffler (16) -6: Smith (F) -4: Im (17) -3: Schwartzel (16) -2: Lowry (17) -1: Thomas (F), Conners (F) E: Willett (F) A 79 for Kevin Na, who ends the day at +5 overall. His partner Dustin Johnson was considered more likely to make a run at Scheffler, but he couldn’t get it going either, and finishes with a pair of bogeys and a 75. He’s +1, and wears the weary look of a man who knows the jig is up. Scheffler, having bogeyed three of the last four holes, doesn’t take any chances at 16. Into the heart of the green, hoping for a two-putt par to steady the listing ship. Schwartzel kind of has to keep the pedal down, though, and goes for the pin. A lovely shot to ten feet. Meanwhile bother for Lowry on 17, who finds the sand at the front of the green, then sends his bunker shot over the back. Scottie Scheffler is faced with a 40-foot downhill tickle from the back of 15. His putt is always missing to the right ... and it keeps on going, nine feet past the pin. All of a sudden, it’s a battle for par ... and he can’t make it, his ball always dying to the right. It’s a third bogey in four holes for the leader, a worrying run all right. This is the first time he’s felt the pressure of leading the Masters ... and it’s only Saturday. Famously, the tournament doesn’t start until the leaders hit the turn tomorrow. Par for Schwartzel. The lead is only three! -9: Scheffler (15) -6: Smith (F) -4: Schwartzel (15) -3: Im (16), Lowry (16) -1: Thomas (F), Conners (F) E: Willett (F), D Johnson (17) +1: Fleetwood (F), Kokrak (F), McIlroy (F), Morikawa (F) Two putts for Im on 16. Lowry nearly holes out from the bunker. A pair of pars. They both stay at -3. Cam Smith whips a delightful wedge up from the back of 18, and in goes the par putt from three feet. He signs for his second 68 of the week. Will yesterday’s 74 end up costing him a green jacket? He’s -6 overall, and hoping Scottie Scheffler, already four clear, doesn’t finish his round with a flourish. Bogey for his partner Corey Conners, though, who ends the day with a level-par 72. He remains -1 overall. A bad break for Im on 16. His tee shot lands ten feet from the flag, and looks like sticking, but ever so slowly turns to the left, then tumbles down the green towards the water. It’s never getting wet, but it stops on the fringe and instead of a look at birdie, he’s left with a long two putts for his par. Lowry meanwhile dumps his effort into the bunker that did for Smith. And back on 15, Scheffler and Smith, having laid up with their second shots, find the green with their wedges ... though neither are particularly close. Still, a couple of birdie putts coming right up! What a putt by Im Sung-jae on 15! A huge 30-foot left-to-right curler from the fringe at the back, and it’s his fourth birdie in eight holes! All of a sudden, he’s back to -3, and may already be ruing that horrible double-bogey start. Meanwhile on 18, Cam Smith pulls his drive towards the trees on the left, but gets a lucky break and is able to power his second onto the green ... and just over the back. He’ll have a tricky chip coming up. What he’d give to get up and down for par and sign his name at the bottom of a 68. Disappointing rounds for Collin Morikawa (74) and Will Zalatoris (75). Zalatoris in particular was looking good for a while, but he sent his third at 13 into Rae’s Creek and ended up with a double-bogey seven. That was the centrepiece of a triptych of horror that saw him ship four shots in three holes. Morikawa’s decline was steadier, with bogeys at 13 and 18. Morikawa ends the day at +1 overall, Zalatoris +2. Scheffler’s right-to-left par putt stays out on the high side. Meanwhile up on 17, Smith gets up and down from the back, and the lead is cut to four. The 2016 champion Danny Willett finishes up with three pars in a row, and his 73 keeps him in good nick for Sunday. -10: Scheffler (14) -6: Smith (17) -4: Schwartzel (14) -3: Lowry (14) -2: Conners (17), Im (14) -1: Thomas (F), D Johnson (16) E: Willett (F) Scheffler punches his wedge up the green. For a second, it looks like trundling into the cup for an outrageous birdie. Instead it rolls a good six feet past. Schwartzel meanwhile pitches back up from way beyond the green. His ball just fails to get over the top of the bank. He clips another attempt to kick-in distance and will settle for bogey. Scheffler splits the 14th fairway, then lands his approach in nearly the perfect spot. One step further, and he’d be ten feet away. But it catches the ridge running across the green, and spins back, all the way off the front. Schwartzel meanwhile flies the green. Up on 17, Smith’s approach nearly holds the back of the green, but takes one roll too many and topples off. Tricky up and downs faced by all. A staunch par for Lowry on 14. Having fired his tee shot into the trees down the right, he slings a low one through the green and down the back. But a gentle wedge wafted gracefully up to five feet offers the opportunity to save par ... and he makes no mistake to remain at -3. Scheffler lays up at 13, then spins a glorious wedge to five feet. So much for any suggestion that doubt is creeping in! Another birdie attempt coming up. Before he can take it, Schwartzel gets down to business and has to settle for par. Then up steps Scheffler, who confidently rolls in to move back to -11 ... and he’s suddenly five clear again, because on 16, Smith splashes out to four feet, only to pull the tickly downhill par putt. Bogey meanwhile for Thomas on 18, and he has to settle for a disappointing 72 that promised so much more. -11: Scheffler (13) -6: Smith (16) -5: Schwartzel (13) -3: Lowry (13) -2: Conners (16), Im (13) -1: Thomas (F), D Johnson (14) Shane Lowry gets in his own way on 15. Having discussed his lay-up yardage with his caddy, he hits a dismal wedge in, 43 feet from the flag. “That was a fucking shit lay-up,” he spits at his looper. Still fuming, he ends up three putting, and drops back to -3. Heading the other way: Cam Smith, who successfully lays up on 15, wedges to five feet, and tidies up for birdie. Suddenly there’s just three in it ... although Smith then dumps his tee shot at 16 into sand, from where he’ll have a testing up and down. -10: Scheffler (12) -7: Smith (15) -5: Schwartzel (12) -3: Lowry (13) -2: Thomas (17), Conners (15), Im (13) -1: D Johnson (14) Are the first slivers of doubt manifesting themselves in Scheffler’s noggin? He takes an age over his tee shot at 13, then sends a hysterical slice miles to the right. By his standards, it’s a short one, too, just 252 yards. It makes his mind up: he has to lay up. Schwartzel meanwhile is in the pine straw on the same side of the hole. Schwartzel very nearly rolls his putt from the fringe of 12 into the cup. That would have been an outrageous birdie after the tee shot into the flowers. Scheffler meanwhile overhits his bunker shot and sends his ball over the back. Left with a similar putt to Schwartzel, he hits a bobbler that stops a couple of feet short. He tidies up for his second bogey of the day. -10: Scheffler (12) -6: Smith (14) -5: Schwartzel (12) It’s been an extremely disappointing day for Patrick Cantlay. The current FedEx Cup champ bogeyed the last three holes to sign for an extremely messy seven-over 79. He’s +8 for the week. His playing partner Webb Simpson cards 73 and ends the day at +2 overall. Meanwhile a second birdie in a row for Justin Thomas, at 17, and the 2017 PGA champion isn’t giving up. He’s back up to -2. Scheffler’s tee shot at 12 is a little nervy. And short. He’s fortunate that his ball makes it to the bunker at the front ... just ... because had it not, it was bouncing back down the bank and into the creek. Schwartzel is up next ... and after taking his sweet time to wonder what the swirling wind is doing, skelps his effort long and left, and high into the bank of azaleas! But he gets a huge break as the ball comes squirting out and back down the slope. He’ll still have some work to do from the fringe at the back, but that’s a massive stroke of luck for the 2011 champ. Birdie for Im at 12, his second in three holes. He’s -2. Schwartzel isn’t able to get up and down at 11 from the 12th tee (!) and slips back to -5. Conners makes his birdie at 14. And a slight shock back at 11, as Scheffler underhits his fairly straight birdie putt, which dies to the left one turn from the hole. Another extremely small bone tossed to the rest of the field. Beggars can’t be choosers. -11: Scheffler (11) -6: Smith (14) -5: Schwartzel (11) -4: Lowry (12) -3: Conners (14) -2: Im (12) -1: Thomas (16), D Johnson (13) Justin Thomas rattles in a birdie putt from the fringe at the back of 16 to return to -1. He’s joined there by Dustin Johnson, who makes back-to-back birdies at 12 and 13. And on 14, Corey Conners wedges from 140 yards to a couple of feet, and will surely be moving up to -2 in a couple of minutes. Charl Schwartzel veers from the sublime to the preposterous. Having holed out for eagle from 136 yards on 10, he now sends a huge slice from the centre of the 11th fairway towards the 12th tee box. Scottie Scheffler responds by sending a gentle draw into the green. He’ll have another fine birdie chance, from ten feet or so. Flustered by nothing, he’s operating on a different plane. This is absurdly good golf! Cam Smith lays up at the par-five 13th. The tactic pays dividend as he wedges to ten feet and rolls in the birdie putt. He joins Schwartzel in second spot at -6. Meanwhile there’s yet another three-putt bogey for Tiger, on 17, followed by yet another double bogey at 18 as he fires his approach into the crowd at the back, hits a hot chip back down the green, then takes three putts to get down. For the first time this week, he looks tired after his herculean effort to get healthy and competitive. A 78, but that doesn’t stop the love pouring down from the gallery. He’s +6. ... and Scheffler bumps his pitch up to 18 inches to salvage his par. To his immense credit, he had immediately congratulated Schwartzel on his eagle with a hand clasp and a wide smile. That’s lovely to see, even in the heat of battle. And that’s some up and down from Zalatoris Country, doubly so given what he’d just witnessed! -11: Scheffler (10) -6: Schwartzel (10) -5: Smith (12) -4: Lowry (10) -2: Conners (12) -1: Willett (14), Morikawa (12), Im (10) Scottie Scheffler crashes a perfect drive down the middle of 10. But then he pulls his second down the swale to the left. That’ll test his resolve ... not least because seconds later, his partner Charl Schwartzel holes out from 136 yards! The 2011 champion lands his ball six feet past the flag, the ball spinning back on a determined journey into the cup! Eagle! The second of the week here, too after Gary Woodland’s effort earlier in the week. You wait 14 years for an eagle on 10, then two come along at once! Schwartzel rises to -6. Over to you, Scottie... A second bogey in four holes for Justin Thomas. This one at 14 is the result of his drive ending up on pine straw down the right. He does well to punch his second out of trouble and onto the fringe at the back of the green, but it’s a treacherous long putt back down, and he ends up taking three. He’s level par, and that opening-day 76 suddenly feels even more costly. The wind is really picking up now. It batters Scottie Scheffler and Charl Schwartzel this way and that on the 9th green, the highest part of the course. Both leave their birdie putts short as a result. Scheffler turns in 33, Schwartzel in 35. Up on 12, Cam Smith rolls an aggressive birdie putt five feet past the hole, but strokes the one coming back straight into the cup. He remains in second, six off the lead. Bogey for his partner Corey Conners, though, who leaves a putt well short from the fringe at the back. And a birdie for Im Sung-jae on 10 to get back into red figures. -11: Scheffler (9) -5: Smith (12) -4: Lowry (9), Schwartzel (9) -2: Conners (12) -1: Willett (13), Morikawa (12), Zalatoris (12), Im (10) Will Zalatoris dunks his tee shot at 12 into the drink. He does well, therefore, to limit the damage to bogey, wedging from the drop zone to ten feet, then steering in the tricky downhill putt. He slips to -1, and he’s back to level par for the day. Meanwhile the leader Scottie Scheffler finds the heart of 9 in regulation, and will have yet another look at birdie. Shane Lowry bashes a perfect drive down 8 ... then undercooks his approach, which topples off the false front and back down the fairway. He tries his best to salvage the situation, wedging to ten feet, but the attempt to save par shaves the hole. He’s -4. Meanwhile yet another three putt for Tiger, this time on 16, and he slips back to +4. Easy to forget now that Jon Rahm was the pre-tournament favourite. He’s had a shocker today ... but having bogeyed 14 and 15, then doubled 17, he rakes in a 40-footer across 18 and cracks a wide, warm, wry smile. Arms aloft. Even when you’re signing for a 77 that takes you down the leader board to +7, there’s nothing like the love from the Augusta patrons on 18. You’ve got to soak it up, these things don’t come around that often. Two putts from the best part of 100 feet from the front of the huge green at the par-five 8th for Charl Schwartzel. A much-needed birdie ... but he makes up no ground on playing partner Scottie Scheffler, who despite driving into sand on the right, then flirting with trees to the left, wedges his third to six feet, and knocks in the putt. Another birdie, and the world number one is relentless. -11: Scheffler (8) -5: Smith (10), Lowry (8) -4: Schwartzel (8) -3: Conners (10) Rory McIlroy pars the last, and he signs for a one-under 71. He won’t be winning this week, but that’s an improvement after a couple of 73s. He’s +1 overall, and has a share of the early clubhouse lead with Tommy Fleetwood and Jason Kokrak. ... or do we talk too soon? Matsuyama wedges his second at 9 to five feet from 100 yards, the topography gathering his ball from left to right towards the hole. In pops the putt, and it’s a desperately needed birdie. That spares the champ the ignominy of turning in 40. He’s level par again. Meanwhile on 11, Zalatoris whistles a brave second straight at the flag, caring not about the water on the left or the swales to the right, then makes a ten footer for a birdie that brings him to -2. News of Hideki Matsuyama, who looks increasingly unlikely to hold onto his title. He makes double bogey on 5, always out of position after driving into the deep bunker to the left of the fairway, then drops another shot at 7. Only a par at 8, and he’s four over for his round already, and +1 overall. One of the shots of the day by Cameron Smith on 10. He flashes an 8-iron at the flag from 180 yards, and tidies up from seven feet. He’s going round with Corey Conners, who matches him shot for shot, drawing his iron into 10 to six feet from the best part of 200 yards. Is that even better? Anyway, both of them determined to stay on Scheffler’s tail. Nobody’s giving anything up yet. -10: Scheffler (7) -5: Smith (10), Lowry (8) -3: Conners (10), Schwartzel (7) -1: Thomas (12), Willett (11), Morikawa (10), Zalatoris (10), Na (9) E: Spaun (13), Bezuidenhout (12), D Johnson (9), Varner III (8) An astonishing up and down from the swale down the left of 10 by Will Zalatoris. It’s a deep, steep bank, and he’s not got much green to play with. But he throws up a high lob, lands ten feet above the pin, then tickles a left-to-right slider down the glassy green to save his par. He remains at -1, where he’s joined by partner Collin Morikawa, who rolls in a birdie putt from 12 feet after arrowing a lovely iron towards the pin from 160 yards. Charl Schwartzel can’t catch a break right now. He sends a lovely second into 7, a few feet from the flag, only for the ball to topple down a ridge to the right and end up 40 feet from the flag. He then nearly drains the long putt for birdie. Just a par. A little bit of spark drains from his eyes as he surveys the scene ... but he’ll be buoyed by Scheffler’s short birdie putt horseshoeing out. Gasps from the gallery, who are just assuming he’ll make everything now. He remains at -10, five clear of Shane Lowry. The leader Scheffler continues to make his way around Augusta with the minimum of fuss. He splits the fairway at 7, then lands his short iron 12 feet past the flag, screwing it back to 12 feet in front, from where he’ll have an uphill putt for another birdie. It’s difficult to imagine Scheffler making any kind of mistake right now, he’s making golf look a breeze. The chasing pack can’t afford slip-ups, though, and on 11, JT shoves a three-footer wide right to slip back to -1. Back-to-back birdies for Tiger, as he sends his second at 13 to 25 feet, but narrowly misses the eagle putt. Still, he’s back to +3. Back on 9, Corey Conners whips his second to kick-in distance, and he turns in 35. The in-form Canadian, who reached the semi-finals of the World Match Play recently, joins Justin Thomas at -2. Birdie for Will Zalatoris at 9, and he turns in level-par 36. He’s -1. Just par for his partner Collin Morikawa, who hits the turn in 37, level par overall. And back on 6, it’s a no-nonsense birdie for the leader Scottie Scheffler, who knocks his tee shot to 12 feet and makes the putt with insouciant ease. He pulls his gilet on as he swans off the green, hands in pockets, looking pretty content with life at the moment. He’s earned the right. -10: Scheffler (6) -5: Lowry (6) -4: Smith (8) -3: Schwartzel (6) It’s worth mentioning Justin Thomas’s antics down 10. Having flayed his drive into the trees down the right, it looked as though his ball had stopped slap bang behind a bush. But upon closer viewing, there was a route through to the green. Channelling the spirit of Bubba Watson in 2012, he punched low and hard through the gap, bundling his ball onto the back fringe of the green ... then nearly drained the birdie putt! That would have been beyond outrageous, but he’s more than happy to settle for a par that seemed a pipe dream when he was walking down to see where his drive had ended up. Anyway, he’s -2. Well, Scheffler sends his second at 5 to the back of the green. He’s left himself a tricky downhill left-to-right putt from 30 feet ... and leaves it a couple of feet out to the left. A second bogey in a row would test the resolve ... but he knocks the par putt in, and remains at -9. However, his lead is suddenly only four strokes, because Shane Lowry has made his second birdie of the afternoon, sticking his tee shot at the par-three 6th to 15 feet, and rolling the rock perfectly! Meanwhile DJ can’t get up and down from greenside sand on 7, and he slips further back, to -1, but Cam Smith birdies 8 to haul himself back into serious contention! -9: Scheffler (5) -5: Lowry (6) -4: Smith (8) -3: Schwartzel (5) -2: Thomas (10) -1: Bezuidenhout (10), Willett (9), Conners (8), D Johnson (7), Na (7) McIlroy creams a fairway wood into the heart of the 15th green, no mean feat given the alterations made to the elongated hole. He’s got a fairly straight eagle putt, albeit from 50 feet. He races it ten feet past, but makes the birdie coming back. A deserved reward for that glorious second shot, from 250 yards onto the narrow green. He’s +1 with dreams of a career slam not yet extinguished ... but he’ll need help from that dude out in the distance. Scottie? ... so having said Tiger’s putter was stone cold, he rolls in a right-to-left curler on 12 for birdie! Just reward for a lovely tee shot that sent his ball to 15 feet. He’s back to +4, and so loud is the roar, which pings around Augusta, that you’d think he was in contention on Sunday. Scheffler sends his tee shot over the back of 4. Not by much, though. In the first cut, a couple of paces down the bank. Out comes the putter. He leaves the left-to-right curler four feet short, then sees his par putt shave the lip on the left and refuse to drop. His first bogey since dropping a stroke at 3 yesterday. A small bone thrown to the rest of the field. -9: Scheffler (4) -4: Lowry (4) -3: Smith (7), Schwartzel (4) -2: Thomas (9), Bezuidenhout (9), D Johnson (6) On 11, it’s another three-putt bogey for Tiger. Throw in that four-putt on 5 and his flat stick has been stone cold today. He’s +5. Speaking of green-related mishaps, McIlroy leaves a straight 15-foot birdie putt short on 14, then fails to catch his putter having angrily sent it twirling it into the sky like Stevie Nicks on PCP. Never a good look when you grab fresh air and your putter goes clanking off down the green. He’s +2. Scottie Scheffler makes no mistake with his birdie putt. It hasn’t taken long for his overnight five-stroke lead to become six. It’d be seven had Shane Lowry not got up and down gracefully from greenside sand at 4. Scheffler’s partner Charl Schwartzel makes a clumsy three-putt bogey to hand back the shot he picked up at 2. Dustin Johnson bogeys 5 after yipping a tiddler. But it’s birdie for Christiaan Bezuidenhout at the par-five 8th. All change! -10: Scheffler (3) -4: Lowry (4) -3: Smith (6), Schwartzel (3) -2: Thomas (8), Bezuidenhout (8), D Johnson (5), Na (5), Matsuyama (4) -1: Kokrak (14), Willett (7), Conners (6), Varner III (4), Im (4) News of the 18-hole leader Im Sung-jae. The 2020 joint runner-up slipped back into the pack after a double bogey on the opening hole. He flew the green from the centre of the fairway, couldn’t get all the way back up from the swale at the back, and took three to get down from the fringe. He’s currently -1 overall through 3. Scheffler sets himself up with a chance to get to double figures on 3. A low-flighted wedge that bites ten feet past the hole. At the moment, he’s giving the field nothing. They’ll have to do it themselves, on current evidence, and so Cam Smith rattles in a 20-footer on the par-three 6th to move to -3. Will Zalatoris, having taken one step forward with that chip-in on 5, takes one back with a thinned wedge on 6. He’s -1. He’s alongside Collin Morikawa, the Open champion enduring an uneven front nine, following up birdie at 3 with bogeys at 4 and 5 and another birdie at 6. Meanwhile on 7, Danny Willett rattles in a 30-footer, and though it’s just for par - he flew a sand shot well past the hole - it’ll feel like a birdie. He stays at -1. A slightly disappointing end to Tommy Fleetwood’s round. Bogey at 17 means he has to settle for a two-under 70. Southport’s finest ends a productive day having moved up the standings to +1, and with Everton less likely to be relegated than they were 24 hours ago. Meanwhile garden-variety birdies for Scottie Scheffler and Charl Schwartzel in the final group, and the leader re-establishes his five-shot cushion at the top. -9: Scheffler (2) -4: Lowry (2), Schwartzel (2) -3: D Johnson (4) -2: Thomas (7), Smith (5), Na (4), Matsuyama (3) Shane Lowry is the first man to take a nibble into Scottie Scheffler’s lead. Just short of the green in two, he bundles a chip up to three feet, and tidies up for birdie. -8: Scheffler (1) -4: Lowry (2) -3: D Johnson (4), Schwartzel (1) -2: Thomas (7), Zalatoris (5), Smith (4), Conners (4), Na (4), Matsuyama (3) Amen Corner (and its immediate environs) did a number on Jason Kokrak yesterday. After bogey at 10, he bogeyed 11 and doubled 12. But he’s had payback today: birdie at 10, then another at 12, and finally a third at 13. After opening rounds of 70 and 76, it’s been an up and down week for the 36-year-old from Ohio, but he’s three under for his round today and back in credit at -1. His best finish here was 49th last year; he’s well on course to best that now. A sensational birdie for Will Zalatoris at 5. He’s short of the green in two. Out comes the wedge, to take out the ridge running across the middle of the putting surface. He lands his ball on the top shelf, where it grips, then rolls serenely into the hole. He’s -2. Matsuyama takes his medicine, chipping back out from the trees down the left of 2. He sends his third to ten feet, but fails to make the birdie putt. Good course management, shame about the flat stick. On that subject, it’s a three-putt bogey for Tiger at 9, and he turns in 39. It’s not been his morning at all, and he’s +4. So is Scheffler on edge as he sets about defending his lead, or not? He pulls his second at 1 down the swale to the right, leaving himself a tricky chip back up with not a whole lot of green to play with. No matter! He sends a crisp, confident wedge to kick-in distance, salvaging his par, and de-jangling those nerves. His partner Schwartzel, pin high and 25 feet to the right, rolls his birdie effort three feet past, but tidies up for par. The final pair remain at -8 and -3 respectively. A late-round birdie blitz from Tommy Fleetwood. Shots picked up at 13, 15 and 16 have whistled him up the standings to level par. No doubt he’s been buoyed by relegation-haunted Everton’s deserved victory over Manchester United earlier in the day. Meanwhile birdie at 2 for Dustin Johnson, bounceback birdie for his playing partner Kevin Na, a dropped stroke by Justin Thomas at the difficult 5th, and a careless bogey for Cam Smith at the short par-four 3rd, means the top of the leader board now looks like this: -8: Scheffler -3: D Johnson (2), Lowry (1), Schwartzel -2: Thomas (6), Willett (4), Smith (3), Conners (3), Na (2), Matsuyama (1) The leader Scottie Scheffler is out ... and if any nerves have been building up as he waited for his tee time, they’re not immediately apparent. He smacks his drive down the track, the ball unluckily sneaking into the second cut on the left. He’s going round today with the 2011 winner Charl Schwartzel, who has missed his last six cuts this year, but now look. He cracks one down the middle, and off we go! An opening bogey for the defending champion Hideki Matsuyama. He got himself back into position after sending his opening drive into the big bunker down the right of Tea Olive, but ended up missing a five-footer for his par. Having slipped back to -2, he’s now hooked his drive at 2 into the trees down the left. Not the start he was after, as he bids to become only the fourth player to retain the Masters, after Jack Nicklaus (1966), Nick Faldo (1990) and Tiger Woods (2002). He’s going round with Harold Varner III, who also bogeys 1 after a wild drive into the pines down the right. He’s -1. Collin Morikawa makes his first move! He drains a 25-footer from the fringe at 3 for a birdie that moves him to -2. Cam Smith meanwhile gets up and down from the front of 2 for a birdie that brings him to -3, as he sets about repairing the damage of yesterday afternoon’s 74-shot struggle. The first few players out this morning are back in the house ... and it’s been an awful day for the 2013 champion Adam Scott. A double-bogey six on 17, run up without any particularly egregious errors, just bang average golf, put the tin lid on an 80. He currently props up the entire leader board at +12. Viktor Hovland meanwhile makes it home with a one-under 71 that brings him up to +3. Danny Willett finished yesterday’s round in very average fashion, coming back in 39 strokes. But he’s clearly not been sulking about it overnight. A first birdie of the day at 3 brings the 2016 champ up to -2. Opening bogey for Kevin Na, however, and the 38-year-old from Vegas slips back to -1 for the tournament. A par-par start for Collin Morikawa. It’s only 53 degrees Fahrenheit, about 12 degrees Celsius, which is way below average for Augusta in April. That, along with the fact that Morikawa is from California, may explain the snood, which nearly covers his entire head, and registers a full 11 on the Nik Kershaw-o-meter. He remains at -1. A confident start by the 2012 US Open champion Webb Simpson. Birdie at 2, followed by a tee shot fired straight at the flag at the par-three 6th. He rolls in from ten feet and joins the group at -1. A fast start for Will Zalatoris, too. He opens with birdie to join the group at -2. But never mind that! It’s another one for JT, who finds sand with his tee shot at the short par-four 3rd, leaves himself 30 feet from the flag, then rattles in the putt to grab himself a share of second. His partner Christian Bezuidenhout also makes birdie, the South African’s first of the day, to move into the red. -8: Scheffler -3: Thomas (3), Schwartzel, Im, Lowry, Matsuyama -2: Zalatoris (1), Smith (1), Varner III, D Johnson, Na -1: Fitzpatrick (4), Bezuidenhout (3), Willett (2), Niemann (2), Conners (1), Morikawa (1) Scottie Scheffler’s antics yesterday slightly obscured the great comeback made by Justin Thomas. Both men shot 67, but while Scheffler’s fine round catapulted him to the top of the standings, JT’s merely hauled him back into contention after an out-of-sorts opening-day 76. Thomas was second favourite with the bookies going into the tournament, and having illustrated why yesterday, he looks in the mood again. In the bunker guarding the front right of 2, he splashes out delicately, the ball only just getting out, then rolling serenely towards the cup. It’s a dimple away from dropping for eagle. In the birdie putt goes, and he’s -2 overall. Disaster for Tiger on 5. He shoves his approach well to the right. He still makes the green, though he’s a good 65 feet from the flag. His first putt stops six feet short. Plenty left to do for par. He doesn’t make it, trickling a gingerly hit effort wide left. He spins around to tap the bogey putt home ... then watches in horror as, having rushed it, he pulls again and it lips out. A double-bogey, four-putt six. He clatters back down the leader board to +3, and there’s no big surprise when he tosses his putter over his shoulder in the vague direction of his bag as a result. Matthew Fitzpatrick has a decent record at Augusta. Solid and consistent, if unspectacular. After missing the cut on debut as an amateur in 2014, he’s made the cut on every visit since, his best finish a tie for seventh in 2016, though he was never in contention to win that year. Starting today at level par through 36 holes, he bogeyed the 1st, but has just bounced back spectacularly with birdies at 2 and 3. He moves into red figures, and gives us our first excuse to update the leader board. -8: Scheffler -3: Schwartzel, Im, Lowry, Matsuyama -2: Varner III, D Johnson, Na, Smith -1: Fitzpatrick (3), Thomas (1), Willett (1), Niemann (1), Conners, Morikawa, Zalatoris E: Simpson (4), Spaun (3), Bezuidenhout (1) It’s pretty chilly by the usual standards of April in Georgia. A cloudy day, and there may be the occasional shower. Perhaps most importantly, the winds are already picking up, and are expected to hover around the 20-25 mph mark all day. The course will get harder and faster as a result. Tiger pulls a fairly dreadful tee shot at the 240-yard 4th - a fairway wood on a par three! - wide of the bunker on the left. He’s faced with a tricky chip over the sand from 30 yards, but screeches his ball to a halt, a couple of feet short of the flag. In goes the par saver, and he remains at +1. Rory rolls another one in! He curls a right-to-left 25-footer into the cup for birdie on 7. All good, except it follows a heavy handed chip from the fringe at 6 that left a six-footer he couldn’t make. Two bogeys and two birdies, and he can get no higher than +2. Victor Hovland only just made the cut after opening rounds of 72 and 76. He needs something really special today - plus a Scottie Scheffler stumble - if he’s to contest tomorrow. That didn’t look on the cards when he went out this morning in 37, but he’s caught alight since turning, with birdies at 10, 11 and now 13. Some way to breeze around Amen Corner. He’s +2. Bounce-back birdie for Tiger! He sends his second at 2 into the sand guarding the front left of the green, then splashes out to three feet. In goes the putt, and he’s back to +1 in short order. It won’t surprise you to hear that the gallery following the five-time champion looks about 20 deep in some places. Thoughts and prayers go out to Kevin Kisner, very much the bridesmaid in this arrangement today. For the record, he’s matched Tiger shot for shot so far, bogey then birdie, and he’s +1 as well. Augusta National was once a mere field, of course, until Bobby Jones, Clifford Roberts and Alister Mackenzie realised their dream. Now look. Such a task may seem daunting, but that’s not put off Dan Davies, whose nascent RNGC “is a ridiculous, homemade homage to the par-three course at Augusta, albeit with many more opportunities for Tony Finau to pop his ankle”. Read on and enjoy! Oh Rory! How could we ever have doubted you! He sends his tee shot at the par-three 4th straight at the flag, but the best part of 40 feet short. No matter! He sends a tramliner into the cup for birdie, to repair the damage of that opening bogey. He’s back where he started the day at +2. Tiger is out and about. Love him or obsess about him, the man is box office. He stripes his first tee shot of the day straight down the track, then knocks his second onto the green, albeit a good 50 feet to the right of the flag. He spends a good couple of minutes prowling around, sizing up all the undulations. He’s surprisingly unsuccessful in his calculations: the pace is fine, but the ball breaks a good ten feet to the left of the hole. He’s now got some work for his par. He can’t make it, and slips back to +2. Meanwhile here’s some rather more successful Fast Start News: birdie for Sergio Garcia at 1, he’s +1 overall, and birdie for Jon Rahm at 2, he’s +1 as well. Unsurprising News dept. Rory McIlroy sent his opening tee shot into the woods down the right of Tea Olive, en route to bogey. He’s since missed a birdie opportunity from ten feet on 3. He’s +3, and those career slam dreams look more and more fanciful as the years go by. On that subject, here’s Steve Buist: “It pains me to say this but I fear Rory has become a head case. I like the guy immensely but I predict he’ll never win another major. Something’s not loggin’ in his noggin. But he owes me nothing. Back in 2011, I was on a golf holiday to Scotland and popped in to a Coral’s in Troon and bet on Rory to win the US Open – when he was leading by 10 strokes or something like that. He held on and I won 86p. I think the Coral’s had to close after that payout.” Here we go, then. Moving Day! And of the early starters, only one man is currently better than one under for his round. Step forward Marc Leishman. The 38-year-old Aussie has three top-ten finishes at Augusta on his CV, the latest being a tie for fifth last year. He also jointly holds the Masters record for lowest cumulative score on the par fives in one tournament, playing them in 15 under par in 2020. Birdies at 2 and 8 today, and he’s hitting the turn in 34. He’s +2 overall. There’s only one place to start. It’s Moving Day! Can anybody hunt down Scottie Scheffler? Will he extend his lead? Will he fall back into the pack? We’ll find out soon enough! Here’s what the top of the leader board looks like … -8: Scheffler -3: Schwartzel, Im, Lowry, Matsuyama -2: Varner III, D Johnson, Na, Smith -1: Conners, Morikawa, Zalatoris, Willett, Niemann, Thomas E: Bezuidenhout, Fitzpatrick, Spaun +1: Simpson, Cantlay, Kisner, Woods +2: MacIntyre, Westwood, Watson, Garcia, Hatton, Rahm, McIlroy, Straka, Swafford, Higgs, Kim, Kokrak, Gooch, Berger, Finau … here are some big names who have missed the cut ...

          "body": "<p>When the news broke last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#eb6579f3d788\">world’s richest man</a>, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/elon-musk-buys-stake-twitter-share-tesla-spacex\">paid $2.9bn</a> (£2.3bn) for 9.2% of Twitter, the media world – old and new – briefly lost what might loosely be called its collective mind. What was Musk up to? (He’s always up to something, after all, even if it’s just trolling. And, with more than 80 million Twitter followers, he’s quite an effective troll.)</p> <p>Since nobody knows what goes on inside Musk’s head, fevered speculation began. One camp thought that he had just done it <a href=\"https://www.wordnik.com/words/lulz\">“for the lulz”</a> (fun, amusement, humour, schadenfreude). Indeed, if your net worth is $290bn, $2.9bn is effectively loose change. And it made him the biggest single shareholder in the company. Twitter then recognised the gravity of the situation and agreed to give him a seat on the board in a deal that supposedly prevents him from buying a majority stake in the business.</p> <p>For what it’s worth, I don’t buy the lulz explanation. Of course Musk loves playing to his vast gallery, but something far more serious is afoot. He wants to make significant changes to the way Twitter works. In particular, he believes the platform ought to have an edit button that would enable people to revise their tweets post-transmission. He polled his Twitter followers asking if they agreed. Of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1511143607385874434\">4.4 million who voted, 73.6% said yes</a>.</p> <p>Why is this interesting? Basically because Musk has a problem with his own addiction to Twitter. It’s called the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/securities-and-exchange-commission\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, the powerful agency of the federal government that was created in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and whose primary purpose is to enforce the law against market manipulation.

          "bodyText": "When the news broke last week that Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s richest man, had paid $2.9bn (£2.3bn) for 9.2% of Twitter, the media world – old and new – briefly lost what might loosely be called its collective mind. What was Musk up to? (He’s always up to something, after all, even if it’s just trolling. And, with more than 80 million Twitter followers, he’s quite an effective troll.) Since nobody knows what goes on inside Musk’s head, fevered speculation began. One camp thought that he had just done it “for the lulz” (fun, amusement, humour, schadenfreude). Indeed, if your net worth is $290bn, $2.9bn is effectively loose change. And it made him the biggest single shareholder in the company. Twitter then recognised the gravity of the situation and agreed to give him a seat on the board in a deal that supposedly prevents him from buying a majority stake in the business. For what it’s worth, I don’t buy the lulz explanation. Of course Musk loves playing to his vast gallery, but something far more serious is afoot. He wants to make significant changes to the way Twitter works. In particular, he believes the platform ought to have an edit button that would enable people to revise their tweets post-transmission. He polled his Twitter followers asking if they agreed. Of the 4.4 million who voted, 73.6% said yes. Why is this interesting? Basically because Musk has a problem with his own addiction to Twitter. It’s called the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the powerful agency of the federal government that was created in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and whose primary purpose is to enforce the law against market manipulation. And Musk has been in conflict with the SEC for quite a while. In 2018, for example, he was sued by the agency after he had tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. He settled the case by giving up his title as chairman and the company agreed to appoint a “Twitter sitter” – a securities lawyer who would henceforth have to approve any written statement Musk made about the company that might contain “material information”. The settlement was updated in 2019 to specify topics he couldn’t tweet about without approval; these included Tesla’s financial condition, earnings forecast, proposed acquisitions and production data. Trying to put a legal muzzle on Musk is like trying to put a lid on Mount Etna and the SEC is investigating whether he has been complying with the 2019 settlement. Having seen some of the stuff he’s tweeted, I’d be amazed if the agency found that he had been in compliance with either the letter or the spirit of the settlement. Last month, he filed a legal suit asking a federal judge to throw out the agreement. Most significantly, his lawyer contended that the SEC is effectively trying to prevent him from exercising his “first amendment rights”. So apparently this is now all about the US government trying to curb the free speech rights of a chief executive to publish anything he likes, including market-sensitive comments about its stock price (as in a Musk tweet of 1 May 2020 that “Tesla stock is too high imo”). Given that Musk’s tweeting incontinence seems incurable, it’ll be interesting to see what the SEC decides. As a government agency, it clearly cannot force Twitter to deplatform him, because that would indeed infringe the first amendment. On the other hand, Twitter could ban him – as it did Donald Trump – because it’s just a public company. although it now happens to be part-owned by him. But what if Musk continues his practice of tweeting what in securities law is regarded as material information about his company – stuff that could affect its share price?

This remarkable image could soon be reality for drivers on one of California’s busiest roads, as the world’s largest wildlife overpass begins construction this month.</p> <p>The history-making project will comprise a green bridge built across the 101 highway near Los Angeles, creating a corridor between two parts of the Santa Monica mountains. Stretching 210ft long and 165ft wide, the overpass will allow safe passage for lizards, snakes, toads and mountain lions, with an acre of local plants on either side and vegetated sound walls to dampen light and noise for nocturnal animals as they slip across.</p> <p>The project, nearly a decade in the making, comes at a crucial time. Highways in this car-heavy landscape crisscross critical habitat for the protected mountain lions and other animals, forcing them to make what can be deadly crossings. At least 25 of the big cats have been killed on Los Angeles freeways since 2002. The latest death was just weeks ago, on 23 March, when a young lion <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-23/mountain-lion-struck-killed-by-car-on-pch\">was struck and killed</a> on the Pacific Coast highway.</p> <p>Beth Pratt, an urban ecologist with the National Wildlife Federation, feels as if she is running the last mile of a marathon. Pratt has spent most of the last decade planning the project, persuading transportation officials of its importance, and bringing together stakeholders and donors to fund it. “I’m a little dizzy still, but I feel relieved: we have the chance to give these mountain lions a shot at a future.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"483338a27a0e1cfb4293e425e9aaadf335698746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483338a27a0e1cfb4293e425e9aaadf335698746/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rendering of the wildlife bridge crossing, which will feature native plants and vegetated walls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rendering of the wildlife bridge crossing, which will feature native plants and vegetated walls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction for the $90m crossing – called the Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing – will take place on Earth Day, 22 April. Construction will mostly happen at night and the project isn’t expected to be complete until early 2025.</p> <p>The bridge’s price tag will be covered by about 60% private donations, with the rest coming from public funds set aside for conservation purposes. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has called the project an “inspiring example” of public-private partnership.</p> <h2>‘A symbol of connection’</h2> <p>The project is breaking the mold in many ways: not only is it the largest crossing in the world, stretching over 10 lanes of one of the busiest roadways in the country, but it’s also an engineering marvel. The crossing is designed to seamlessly integrate into the mountains, offering big cats, coyotes, deer, lizards, snakes and other creatures a safe way to travel to different parts of open territory in the Santa Monica mountains recreation area – a 150,000-acre space.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is restoring a piece of lost habitat, putting it back across the mountains</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Rock, architect</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robert Rock, a landscape architect with Living Futures in Chicago who led the design, says this nature-centered type of construction makes it unusual among other wildlife bridges and underpasses around the world,<strong> </strong>which are typically made of cement and steel.

          "bodyText": "Imagine cruising down a 10-lane highway and knowing that, high above your head, a mountain lion is quietly going along its way. This remarkable image could soon be reality for drivers on one of California’s busiest roads, as the world’s largest wildlife overpass begins construction this month. The history-making project will comprise a green bridge built across the 101 highway near Los Angeles, creating a corridor between two parts of the Santa Monica mountains. Stretching 210ft long and 165ft wide, the overpass will allow safe passage for lizards, snakes, toads and mountain lions, with an acre of local plants on either side and vegetated sound walls to dampen light and noise for nocturnal animals as they slip across. The project, nearly a decade in the making, comes at a crucial time. Highways in this car-heavy landscape crisscross critical habitat for the protected mountain lions and other animals, forcing them to make what can be deadly crossings. At least 25 of the big cats have been killed on Los Angeles freeways since 2002. The latest death was just weeks ago, on 23 March, when a young lion was struck and killed on the Pacific Coast highway. Beth Pratt, an urban ecologist with the National Wildlife Federation, feels as if she is running the last mile of a marathon. Pratt has spent most of the last decade planning the project, persuading transportation officials of its importance, and bringing together stakeholders and donors to fund it. “I’m a little dizzy still, but I feel relieved: we have the chance to give these mountain lions a shot at a future.” A groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction for the $90m crossing – called the Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing – will take place on Earth Day, 22 April. Construction will mostly happen at night and the project isn’t expected to be complete until early 2025. The bridge’s price tag will be covered by about 60% private donations, with the rest coming from public funds set aside for conservation purposes. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has called the project an “inspiring example” of public-private partnership. ‘A symbol of connection’ The project is breaking the mold in many ways: not only is it the largest crossing in the world, stretching over 10 lanes of one of the busiest roadways in the country, but it’s also an engineering marvel. The crossing is designed to seamlessly integrate into the mountains, offering big cats, coyotes, deer, lizards, snakes and other creatures a safe way to travel to different parts of open territory in the Santa Monica mountains recreation area – a 150,000-acre space. Robert Rock, a landscape architect with Living Futures in Chicago who led the design, says this nature-centered type of construction makes it unusual among other wildlife bridges and underpasses around the world, which are typically made of cement and steel. This one is designed to seamlessly glide into the environment on both sides – and send a message to the people driving below. His team includes a soil scientist – who collected samples nearby that are specific to the local trees – and a mycologist, who is studying the fungi of the area and how they can help the seamless flow of plants and animals across the overpass. Docents will be posted nearby to discourage people from exploring the overpass. (Pratt says that planting poison oak and posting signs about rattlesnakes are also effective tools to keep humans off the bridge.) Rock says he is optimistic that the investment could serve as a precedent for how design can play a restorative role in the natural world. “As both a tool for and a symbol of connection, it will stand as an alluring challenge to future generations to pick up the mantle of design to bridge the gaps elsewhere in our world,” he says. Approximately 300,000 cars pass through this area each day, and Pratt calls it an opportunity for millions of Angelenos to see how humans can live more harmoniously with nature. “Someone could be in rush-hour traffic, and there could be a mountain lion right above them,” she says. “I think that’s such a hopeful image, and one that inspires me that we can right some of these great wrongs.” Pratt says the plight of the region’s mountain lions caught the eye of donors from around the world.

We’re certainly not going to bend the knee to woke executives in California,” he added, referring to Disney’s corporate headquarters in Burbank.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, denied DeSantis was seeking “retaliation” over Disney for its stance.</p> <p>“For his entire political career, his position has always been that all businesses should be able to compete on a fair playing field, and that it’s wrong for governments to dole out favors to politically connected companies,” she said.</p> <p>But records show that Disney, which announced last month it was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/disney-pauses-political-donations-in-florida-over-dont-say-gay-bill-backlash.html\">suspending all political donations in the state</a> as the “don’t say gay” bill progressed, contributed almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020, and $50,000 directly to DeSantis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an analysis compiled by Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman representing Disney’s central Florida heartland, lists <a href=\"https://annaveskamani.medium.com/a-quick-look-at-some-of-disneys-recent-perks-from-florida-state-officials-91ddc2e56990\">decades of perks and privileges</a> she says the company has enjoyed from lawmakers.</p> <p>They feature millions of dollars in sales and property tax breaks, corporate income tax refunds, and language inserted into, or left out of certain legislation that would affect the company, including a human trafficking bill that could have exposed its hotels to lawsuits, and an exemption to regulations over materials used in road construction on Disney property.</p> <p>“The governor hasn’t held the company accountable beyond yelling about it on Fox News,” said Eskamani, who stressed that she accepts no corporate campaign contributions.</p> <p>“Disney’s business model, and tax structures, have remained unchanged, and even <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article260033195.html\">the governor’s office has helped Disney maintain special privileges</a>. So much of this I find to be ironic.</p> <p>“But that’s not what he’s talking about. He’s talking about specific, punitive punishments of one company because they dare speak out against a homophobic and transphobic bill because they have LGBTQ+ employees who are scared for their health and wellbeing.</p> <p>“[Disney] needs to recruit and retain diverse staff and will not be able to do that the direction Florida is going. As economic partners they have every right to express themselves, but under the DeSantis administration, if you dare challenge him, he will bully you into submission.”</p> <p>Pushback on DeSantis has also come from Republicans. Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, told CNN: “The whole thing seems like just a crazy fight. The bill was kind of absurd and not something that would have happened in our state.”</p> <p>For its part, Disney appears to have been caught wrong-footed by the furore. The company was accused of voicing its opposition late, and issuing its statement only after an outcry and walkout by cast members.</p> <p>Chief executive Bob Chapek apologized for “pain, frustration and sadness” caused by its earlier silence in a letter aimed at its LBGTQ+ workers. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down,” he wrote.</p> <p>The misstep also allowed DeSantis to seize on perceived “dishonesty” by Disney, which employs dozens of lobbyists in Tallahassee but did not use them to speak with lawmakers as the law was drafted.</p> <p>“They didn’t seem to have a problem with it when it was going through. This was such an affront, why weren’t they speaking up at the outset?” DeSantis said.</p> <p>In a further blow to Disney’s attempts to make amends, the Human Rights Campaign is refusing a $5m donation until the company proves its commitment to work with LGBTQ+ advocates to overturn the “don’t say gay” law.</p> <p>Disney did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p> <p>“Disney is caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Charles Zelden, professor of humanities and politics at Nova Southeastern University and a longtime Florida Disney watcher.</p> <p>“I suspect their lobbyists told them, ‘You know, keep quiet on this’ and that’s what they tried to do, but then they couldn’t because the cast members rose up and said, ‘You got to object to this’. They can’t afford to alienate not only their cast members but people who support a more liberal, diverse society.”</p> <p>Zelden said he was curious about DeSantis’s next move.</p> <p>“Disney has all these lobbyists to make sure they don’t lose their special taxing district. So it just means that the fight will progress into the legislature, and they’ve got a heck of a tool with their money and their clout to fend off concrete attacks,” he said.</p> <p>“The verbal attacks will continue, but as long as it stays that way, the Mouse is all right.”</p>",

We’re certainly not going to bend the knee to woke executives in California,” he added, referring to Disney’s corporate headquarters in Burbank. In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, denied DeSantis was seeking “retaliation” over Disney for its stance. “For his entire political career, his position has always been that all businesses should be able to compete on a fair playing field, and that it’s wrong for governments to dole out favors to politically connected companies,” she said. But records show that Disney, which announced last month it was suspending all political donations in the state as the “don’t say gay” bill progressed, contributed almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020, and $50,000 directly to DeSantis. Meanwhile, an analysis compiled by Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman representing Disney’s central Florida heartland, lists decades of perks and privileges she says the company has enjoyed from lawmakers. They feature millions of dollars in sales and property tax breaks, corporate income tax refunds, and language inserted into, or left out of certain legislation that would affect the company, including a human trafficking bill that could have exposed its hotels to lawsuits, and an exemption to regulations over materials used in road construction on Disney property. “The governor hasn’t held the company accountable beyond yelling about it on Fox News,” said Eskamani, who stressed that she accepts no corporate campaign contributions. “Disney’s business model, and tax structures, have remained unchanged, and even the governor’s office has helped Disney maintain special privileges. So much of this I find to be ironic. “But that’s not what he’s talking about. He’s talking about specific, punitive punishments of one company because they dare speak out against a homophobic and transphobic bill because they have LGBTQ+ employees who are scared for their health and wellbeing. “[Disney] needs to recruit and retain diverse staff and will not be able to do that the direction Florida is going. As economic partners they have every right to express themselves, but under the DeSantis administration, if you dare challenge him, he will bully you into submission.” Pushback on DeSantis has also come from Republicans. Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, told CNN: “The whole thing seems like just a crazy fight. The bill was kind of absurd and not something that would have happened in our state.” For its part, Disney appears to have been caught wrong-footed by the furore. The company was accused of voicing its opposition late, and issuing its statement only after an outcry and walkout by cast members. Chief executive Bob Chapek apologized for “pain, frustration and sadness” caused by its earlier silence in a letter aimed at its LBGTQ+ workers. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down,” he wrote. The misstep also allowed DeSantis to seize on perceived “dishonesty” by Disney, which employs dozens of lobbyists in Tallahassee but did not use them to speak with lawmakers as the law was drafted. “They didn’t seem to have a problem with it when it was going through. This was such an affront, why weren’t they speaking up at the outset?” DeSantis said. In a further blow to Disney’s attempts to make amends, the Human Rights Campaign is refusing a $5m donation until the company proves its commitment to work with LGBTQ+ advocates to overturn the “don’t say gay” law. Disney did not respond to emails seeking comment. “Disney is caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Charles Zelden, professor of humanities and politics at Nova Southeastern University and a longtime Florida Disney watcher. “I suspect their lobbyists told them, ‘You know, keep quiet on this’ and that’s what they tried to do, but then they couldn’t because the cast members rose up and said, ‘You got to object to this’. They can’t afford to alienate not only their cast members but people who support a more liberal, diverse society.” Zelden said he was curious about DeSantis’s next move. “Disney has all these lobbyists to make sure they don’t lose their special taxing district. So it just means that the fight will progress into the legislature, and they’ve got a heck of a tool with their money and their clout to fend off concrete attacks,” he said. “The verbal attacks will continue, but as long as it stays that way, the Mouse is all right.”",

          "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, bowed to pressure to pay UK taxes on Friday night, after Boris Johnson said he had been unaware she was a “non-dom” and fresh questions emerged over the couple’s tax affairs. With Sunak’s position under increasing threat, Murty said she realised many people felt her tax arrangements were not “compatible with my husband’s job as chancellor”, adding that she appreciated the “British sense of fairness”. She will pay tax on all worldwide income in future and for the last tax year, but not on backdated income, which could have saved her an estimated £20m of UK tax on foreign earnings from her billionaire father’s Indian IT company. However, her decision is unlikely to stop the scrutiny of Sunak and Murty’s tax affairs and financial interests, with calls from Labour and the Lib Dems for an investigation into whether Sunak has broken the ministerial code by failing to be transparent. Sunak was on Friday forced to confirm he had a US green card – meaning he had declared himself a “permanent US resident” for tax purposes for 19 months while he was chancellor and for six years as an MP. A source close to the couple also confirmed Murty held a green card as well. The disclosure appears at odds with Sunak’s defence of his wife being a non-dom – he said she intended to one day return to live in India. The Guardian has also discovered the Treasury last week brought in a new low tax scheme that is partly designed to benefit some wealthy non-dom investors – just days before Sunak’s national insurance rise hit millions of working people at the height of a cost of living crisis. The new laws specifically mention fund manager non-doms as a category of people who can benefit by not having to pay tax on foreign earnings through the new vehicles. The Treasury had previously claimed Sunak had made no changes to non-dom policy since 2017, raising new questions over whether the Treasury was fully informed about Sunak’s family’s tax arrangements when formulating policy. In a press conference on Friday, Johnson admitted he had not been told about Murty’s non-dom status. But he denied anyone at No 10 was briefing against the Sunaks, and praised the chancellor for doing an “outstanding job”. However, Downing Street insiders revealed that an away day this week descended into acrimony between No 10 and No 11 aides, over the source of the Murty leak and longstanding tensions over the Partygate scandal. Tory MPs said they believed it was possible Johnson could seek to move Sunak from the Treasury in a summer or autumn reshuffle if he survives the current crisis threatening his chancellorship. The revelations have prompted a political outcry over Sunak’s lack of transparency about his wife’s financial affairs. While promising to pay UK tax on all income, Murty will retain her non-dom status, which could in future allow her family to legally avoid an inheritance tax bill of more than £275m. In her statement, Murty said she did not want her non-dom status to be a “distraction” for her husband. “For this reason, I will no longer be claiming the remittance basis for tax,” she said. “This means I will now pay UK tax on an arising basis on all my worldwide income, including dividends and capital gains, wherever in the world that income arises. I do this because I want to, not because the rules require me to. “These new arrangements will begin immediately and will also be applied to the tax year just finished.” UK taxpayers are required to pay a 40% take on inheritance (above £325,000), while non-doms are exempt from the tax. Murty has assets of at least £690m held in Infosys shares, tax charged on this at a rate of 40% would be £276m. Murty and Sunak also own four properties worth more than £15m in total, and she also holds substantial investments in other companies. It is understood Sunak and Murty, who own a £5.5m California penthouse holiday home, have donated $3m (£2.3m) to a US university in recent years. The chancellor’s spokesperson insisted that under US law “you are not presumed to be a US resident just by dint of holding a green card”. She said Sunak followed all guidance and continued to file US tax returns, but specifically as a non-resident, in full compliance with the law. “As required under US law and as advised, he continued to use his green card for travel purposes. Upon his first trip to the US in a government capacity as chancellor, he discussed the appropriate course of action with the US authorities. At that point it was considered best to return his green card, which he did immediately. “All laws and rules have been followed and full taxes have been paid where required in the duration he held his green card.” Holders of green cards are required to pay US tax on their worldwide income – and also to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. They are required to file annual US tax returns, and are “responsible for reporting your income and paying taxes on any foreign earned income”. This raises the suggestion that Sunak may have been required to pay US tax on his publicly funded MP’s salary. Under non-dom rules, Murty did not legally have to pay tax in the UK on the estimated £11.5m in annual dividends she collects from her stake in Infosys, her billionaire father’s IT business. UK tax residents would be expected to pay about £4.5m in tax on the dividend payment. Murty has said she paid tax on the dividends overseas, but has refused to state how much she paid or in which country. She has previously collected other shareholder income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has written to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, demanding an urgent inquiry. His letter said: “How could the man who is responsible for UK tax policy regard any permanent residency status for the United States as acceptable? This would be a huge conflict of interest – and a serious breach of the ministerial code.” Sunak earlier told the Sun that Murty “loves her country like I love mine”, and said she had always been domiciled in India. He said she was entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she was an Indian citizen and planned to move back to her home country to care for her parents. Under non-dom rules, Murty previously paid £30,000 a year for the right not to pay UK tax on her overseas income.

Sunak told the Sun: “She loves her country like I love mine,” and said his wife had done nothing wrong in choosing a financial arrangement that legally exempts her from paying tax in Britain on foreign income. Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty had US green cards and were declared “permanent US residents” for tax purposes while Sunak served as chancellor. Sunak and Murty, who own a £5.5m California penthouse holiday home, held green cards while they lived in the US and continued to keep the status when they moved to the UK. The shadow attorney general has said that the chancellor’s wife is “taking advantage” of her decision to claim non-domicile status to avoid paying taxes. Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the end, we have somebody who’s been living here for eight years, raising her children here, living at … Downing Street in accommodation provided by the taxpayer and aspiring to be the wife of the next prime minister, and yet she says that she isn’t a permanent resident of this country.” Boris Johnson insisted Rishi Sunak had done “absolutely everything” required after it was reported he held a US green card for a period while chancellor. He added: “I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job.” Russia may have committed another war crime by targeting civilians fleeing from an eastern Ukraine railway station with precision missiles, the defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace vowed to “do everything” to ensure Vladimir Putin fails in Ukraine. Boris Johnson and Olaf Scholz held talks and a press conference at Downing Street. The prime minister said he was “absolutely thrilled” to be hosting the German chancellor at Downing Street during a “very important” time for Europe, Ukraine and the countries’ bilateral relations. Boris Johnson said the attack on fleeing civilians at the Kramatorsk train station was “unconscionable”, as he suggested Vladimir Putin’s forces were guilty of a war crime. He said: The attack at the train station in eastern Ukraine shows the depth to which Putin’s once vaunted army has sunk.” Boris Johnson welcomed German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s “seismic” attempts to divest from Russian fossil fuels after the pair met in Downing Street. Johnson told a joint No 10 press conference they agreed on the importance of weaning off Russian oil and gas. Priti Patel has apologised for the time it has taken for Ukrainian refugees to arrive in the UK under two visa schemes, after new figures showed just 12,000 have so far reached Britain. Boris Johnson hinted at a disagreement with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, over triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which he refused to rule out, despite the war in Ukraine. Boris Johnson has said it would be “irresponsible” to rule out further lockdowns if more deadly coronavirus variants emerge. The prime minister continued to say he could not rule out the prospect of taking drastic action again as the nation feels the impact of the Omicron variant, PA Media reports. The number of Covid-19 infections remains at or near record levels in most of the UK, with only Scotland seeing a drop, new figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. The ONS data for the week ending 2 April, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, shows that, for the second week running, about one in 13 people across the UK are thought to have had Covid – an estimated 4.88 million infections. Outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has warned against the “politicisation of policing”, saying it is “a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system”. She left Scotland Yard this morning and was applauded by officers as she walked out. That’s it from me today. Thanks for joining me. My colleague Jessica Elgot has looked at whether Rishi Sunak has blown his chances of ever becoming the leader of the Conservatives, which you may find interesting. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Rishi Sunak has admitted holding a US green card while chancellor but said he immediately returned it after seeking guidance upon his first American trip in a government capacity in October 2021, according to a statement from his spokesperson. A spokesperson for the chancellor said: Rishi Sunak had a green card when he lived and worked in the US. Under US law, you are not presumed to be a US resident just by dint of holding a green card. Furthermore, from a US immigration perspective, it is presumed that permanent resident status is automatically abandoned after prolonged absences from the US. At the same time, one is required to file US tax returns. Rishi Sunak followed all guidance and continued to file US tax returns, but specifically as a non-resident, in full compliance with the law. As required under US law and as advised, he continued to use his green card for travel purposes. Upon his first trip to the US in a government capacity as chancellor, he discussed the appropriate course of action with the US authorities. At that point it was considered best to return his green card, which he did immediately. All laws and rules have been followed and full taxes have been paid where required in the duration he held his green card. Boris Johnson hinted at a disagreement with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, over triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which he refused to rule out, despite the war in Ukraine. He told a Downing Street press conference: It came up, I think I raised it. It was entirely predictable. The almost seamless harmony that you have observed between Britain and Germany today I would not wish to interrupt by going any further. But what I will say to answer your question, will we take that off the table, the use of Article 16 – no clearly not, there is a problem. But he said the two countries were in agreement on “virtually every other issue” of policy. Boris Johnson has praised the “huge steps” EU countries are already taking to wean themselves off Russian energy. Speaking at a press conference at Downing Street alongside the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he said: Just bear in mind the huge steps that the EU are already taking and the Germans are already taking to move away from from oil and gas. The dependency has been massive. It’s clearly been something that they’re now moving away from very, very fast. I think by the middle of 2024, as I recall, Germany’s going to stop using Russian gas, which is quite extraordinary. And that is going to be done through technological change and progress and we want to work together with Germany to achieve that. Scholz has said Germany is doing “all we can” to wean itself off Russian energy but that it will take two decades. He told a joint press conference with Johnson that Germany is working on becoming a country that will just use renewables to generate its electricity. He said this will be achieved through offshore and onshore wind, solar and investment into its grid, but he acknowledged it would take “approximately 20 years”. He added: It is absolutely necessary that we understand that for the time being between, it will be important to get the supply from fossil resources from other places than from Russia. We are doing so and working very hard to make this happen. Boris Johnson does not rule out considering arming Ukraine’s resistance against Russian troops with tanks. The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: I’m in principle willing to consider anything by way of defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians protect themselves and their people. I think it’s important that we should be giving equipment that is genuinely useful and is operable by Ukrainians, that’s our consideration. The press conference has ended now. Both leaders have left the room. Asked about criticism of Emmanuel Macron, who has continued to have conversations with Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine began, Boris Johnson said he admired efforts by those continuing diplomatic conversations but was “cynical” and did not trust Putin. The prime minister said he last spoke to the Russian president before the invasion, when Putin said he had no plans to invade Ukraine. He said: Negotiating with Putin does not seem to me to be full of promise … That is not to say that I don’t admire the efforts of those try to find a way through, but for myself I am very sceptical and indeed cynical. Scholz said that criticism of Macron was “unjustified”. He said the French president is “very committed” and “tries to make his contribution”. Scholz said he has told Putin about Russian losses because he may not hear it from his inner circle in the Kremlin. Boris Johnson has dodged a question on Rishi Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status. He said: I would just stress that the chancellor, Rishi, is doing an absolutely outstanding job and, as far as possible, as I think I said yesterday, I don’t think people’s families should be dragged into this. He was later asked another question on the issue and said he did not know about Akshata Murty’s tax status before the news broke. He also denied that No 10 had been briefing against Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, as has been reported. He said he didn’t know where the briefings were coming from, if there have been any. If there are such briefings they’re certainly not coming from us. He added that he thought Sunak was doing a “fantastic job”. Asked if Sunak had his full backing, he replied: “Emphatically yes.” Boris Johnson welcomed German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s “seismic” attempts to divest from Russian fossil fuels after the pair met in Downing Street. Johnson told a joint No 10 press conference they agreed on the importance of weaning off Russian oil and gas. He said: This is not easy for any of us and I applaud the seismic decisions taken by Olaf’s government to move Germany away from Russian hydrocarbons. We cannot transform our respective energy systems overnight but we also know that (Vladimir) Putin’s war will not end overnight. He said they both agreed the need to maximise potential of the North Sea and collaborate on energy security and renewables. Johnson also said the two nations will hold a joint cabinet meeting within the next year. Olaf Scholz said cooperation between Germany and UK will be important as Germany weans itself off Russian fossil fuels. The German chancellor said: We are going to intensify our cooperation on all levels. We want to make progress and intensify relations between our two countries. Asked whether Germany and the EU need to move faster on cutting off Russian oil and gas, Scholz said: We are doing all we can, and we are doing a lot ... We are actively working to get independent from the import of oil and we think we will be able to make it this year. He also said it is “not feasible” to replace gas with other sources immediately because of the need to build new infrastructure to handle it. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, promises to end the use of fossil fuels. Germany is heavily dependent on oil, coal and natural-gas imports from Russia, which is why this is a big step. He said: Germany is already starting to wean itself off its dependence. We’re investigating large scale... in order to import gas via the northern German shores. The country will import natural gas via North Sea ports rather than through Russian pipelines, he adds. Olaf Scholz is speaking now. He thanked Boris Johnson for hosting him at Downing Street and says they have had many conversations in recent weeks but that it was good to meet in person. He said: Killing civilians is a war crime and the Russian president bears the responsibility for these war crimes. Boris Johnson and I share this assessment. I call upon Russia again to finally agree a ceasefire and withdraw its troops. This war needs to stop immediately. Boris Johnson said: The Europe we knew just six weeks ago no longer exists. But says Putin has “succeeded in uniting Europe and the whole transatlantic alliance in support of Ukraine and in solidarity with each other”. He added that the UK and Germany “will hold a joint cabinet meeting between our two governments within the next year”. Boris Johnson said the UK will send another £100m of high-grade equipment to Ukraine including Starstreak missiles, anti-tank missiles, precision munitions capable of “lingering in the sky”, plus extra helmets, body armour and night vision. He told a Downing Street press conference: Today I can announce the UK will send a further £100m of high-grade military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, which fly at three times the speed of sound, another 800 anti-tank missiles and precision munitions capable of lingering in the sky until directed to their target. Boris Johnson and the German chancellor Olaf Scholz are holding a joint press conference in Downing Street. Johnson accused Russia of war crimes. He said: It is a war crime indiscriminately to attack civilians. Russia’s crimes in Ukraine will not go unnoticed or unpunished. Johnson said the attack on fleeing civilians at the Kramatorsk train station was “unconscionable”, as he suggested Vladimir Putin’s forces were guilty of a war crime. He told a Downing Street press conference: The attack at the train station in eastern Ukraine shows the depth to which Putin’s once vaunted army has sunk. At least 39 people killed and dozens wounded on a train platform crowded with women and children. It is a war crime indiscriminately to attack civilians and Russian crimes in Ukraine will not go unnoticed or unpunished. Boris Johnson has said he is “absolutely thrilled” to be hosting the German chancellor at Downing Street during a “very important” time for Europe, Ukraine and the countries’ bilateral relations. Speaking in No 10, the prime minister said: The relations between the UK and Germany are absolutely crucial, crucial, crucial for both of us and we have a lot to talk about. He thanked Olaf Scholz for coming, who replied: “Thank you for having me here.” Outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has warned against the “politicisation of policing”, saying it is “a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system”. She left Scotland Yard this morning and was applauded by officers as she walked out. In a “letter to London”, Dick wrote: Of course as I look back there is more I wish we had achieved. We hear the criticism, know not everyone has confidence in us to provide a good service when they need us, and have seen among us those whose horrific actions have let you all, and us, down so terribly. Each one drives us to get better, to root out those who don’t uphold our standards and don’t deserve to wear our uniform. To improve our response so all our communities feel protected by us. We are listening and acting on what you tell us so we can change for the better. Just this week we launched our violence against women and girls plan, shaped by the views of hundreds of Londoners. The current politicisation of policing is a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system. Operational independence from local and central government is crucial for an effective democracy and is a model respected around the world. We must all treasure and protect it. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has arrived in Downing Street for talks. Boris Johnson will appear alongside Scholz at 3.15pm as Britain and Germany present a united front amid the war in Ukraine. Johnson is expected to offer assistance to Berlin, which is still heavily reliant on Russian gas, to reduce its dependence on Moscow’s energy exports in a bid to starve Vladimir Putin’s war machine of funds. The prime minister is expected to urge Scholz’s government to ramp up sanctions on the Kremlin following reports of war crimes being carried out by Russian soldiers in the outskirts of Kyiv. In a tweet, Johnson said: “Looking forward to welcoming BundesKanzler Scholz to the UK today. “I welcome his principled determination to end dependence on Russian energy. How we respond to Russia’s invasion will define the international order for years to come. We cannot let Putin’s crimes go unpunished.” Pressed on whether he thinks the station attack was a war crime, Ben Wallace said evidence would be collected to prove the answer, but added: “The circumstantial evidence absolutely points to a range of war crimes being committed by Russia.” Wallace insisted Putin’s war would backfire.”There will be more Ukraine after this, there will be more forces on the border with Nato, there may be more Nato members as a result of Putin’s actions,” Wallace said. Russia may have committed another war crime by targeting civilians fleeing from an eastern Ukraine railway station with precision missiles, the defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace vowed to “do everything” to ensure Vladimir Putin fails in Ukraine and predicted the war would backfire for the Russian president, perhaps getting more nations to join the Nato defence alliance, PA reports. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at least 30 people were killed in the attack on the crowded Kramatorsk station, which was an evacuation point for civilians. A further 100 people were injured, Zelenskiy said as he blamed Russia for “an evil without limits”, while the Kremlin denied targeting the station. Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said the strike was a repeat of the Russian president and his generals targeting civilians. Speaking in Constanta, he said: Not very far away this morning in a place called Kramatorsk, what appears to be Russian missiles struck civilian people queueing for trains to seek a safer place from the war. The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime. These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter. Wallace said the sanctions targeting Russia must not be lifted to allow Putin to go back to “his superyachts and normality”. “Whatever happens in Ukraine, we must not let the international community forget that. What Putin is doing here today is creating his own cage around himself,” he said. He said the RAF will increase its contribution to protect Nato’s eastern flank in Romania from four to six planes, “because Putin listens to only one thing and that is strength”. “We will do everything to see him defeated in Ukraine. There is more to do, Britain will do more, it will contribute more,” he added. Boris Johnson has moved to paper over differences with Germany on support for Ukraine, by hailing Berlin’s “principled determination” to end its dependency on Russian energy before a meeting in London with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. It is the first meeting between the two men since the Social Democrat Scholz was elected to lead a three-party coalition government, and follows a week in which Germany resisted British calls for the major economies to set out a timetable to end dependency on Russian energy. In advance of the meeting with Scholz in Downing Street, the UK prime minister said: “I welcome his principled determination to end dependence on Russian energy. How we respond to Russia’s invasion will define the international order for years to come. We cannot let Putin’s crimes go unpunished.” Scholz has been criticised domestically and by Ukrainian politicians for not moving fast enough to wean Germany off its decades-old dependency on cheap Russian energy, and for being slow to back the transfer of the heavy weaponry Ukraine needs. He has also been warned by German industrialists that an immediate gas embargo would lead to mass unemployment, a position largely shared by the Green party, his coalition partners. The number of Covid-19 infections remains at or near record levels in most of the UK, with only Scotland seeing a drop, new figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. The ONS data for the week ending 2 April, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, shows that, for the second week running, about one in 13 people across the UK are thought to have had Covid – an estimated 4.88 million infections. However, the picture varied between countries. In England, the number of infections for the week remained steady, with an estimated 7.6% or one in 13 people in the community thought to have had Covid. In Wales, the estimated rate was up from one in 14 people to one in 13. In Scotland, 396,800 people – about one in 13, down from one in 12 the previous week – were estimated to have had the virus. Sadiq Khan has said the protest by Extinction Rebellion (XR) climate activists that shut down Tower Bridge on Friday morning was “counterproductive”. Speaking at the launch of Labour’s local election campaign in Barnet, north London, the London mayor said: “I think one of the things that those who feel passionate about something have to do is to win over public opinion at the same time as putting pressure on the government. “My concern is some of the actions of XR discourage people from joining the campaign and don’t affect government policy. “I think all campaigns or protests should be peaceful, lawful and safe, and I’m concerned that some of the tactics being used are counterproductive.” Police were called to the bridge at about 7.30am after protesters from Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion occupied the famous landmark and unfurled a green banner with black writing, which read “End fossil fuels now”. The demonstrators suspended themselves from the bridge on ropes, with police shutting it for several hours. Officers cleared the protesters by 11.40am, escorting them into police vehicles, and the bridge was reopened at midday. Councils are seeing a “concerning increase” in Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK and becoming homeless due to relationship breakdowns with their sponsors and problems accessing accommodation. PA reports that Ukrainian families who arrived under the family visa scheme are struggling to access cash while they wait for benefits, and some are being put in hotels because their relative is unable or unwilling to house them. Dozens of matches under the separate Homes for Ukraine scheme are understood to have broken down, with local authorities having to put families in emergency accommodation while they wait to find a new sponsor. Councils are calling for a way to get refugees whose matches have broken down back on the database so that they can be matched quickly with sponsors in the local area who have homes ready and waiting. They are also exploring with the government the possibility of matching people who cannot stay with their family sponsor with sponsors registered under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), councillor James Jamieson, said councils need to be told in advance who is arriving under the family scheme and given funding so they can support them. He said: “Councils are already seeing a concerning increase in homelessness presentations from Ukraine arrivals – including those who have arrived via the family scheme and where the families’ accommodation is not suitable or the relationship has broken down shortly after arrival – and lone children arriving in the UK needing support. “New arrivals should be able to be rematched with a different sponsor if a sponsorship breaks down, to ensure families can swiftly move to other accommodation so they can rebuild their lives in their new communities.” In a survey published last week, the LGA said 57 councils have been approached by a total of 144 Ukrainian households who have become homeless after arriving under both schemes. The British Red Cross said it has had to refer people to homelessness charities, local authorities and housing associations due to problems getting funds or accommodation. In some cases it has had to fund short-term accommodation itself as an emergency measure. The charity says more must be done to tackle these “basic problems”. Alex Fraser, British Red Cross director of refugee support and restoring family links, said: “We’re increasingly concerned about the access to information about support people are receiving when they arrive. “We’re seeing an increasing number of calls to our support line from Ukrainians struggling to get cash and housing, and British families desperate to help but being prevented by the system.” Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty had US green cards and were declared “permanent US residents” for tax purposes while Sunak served as chancellor. Sunak and Murty, who own a £5.5m Californian penthouse holiday home, held green cards while they lived in the US and continued to keep the status when they moved to the UK before Sunak was elected MP for Richmond (Yorks) in 2015. Sky News first reported that Sunak continued to hold a green card for at least a year of his chancellorship, which began in 2020. The Treasury and Murty’s personal spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. A source close to the couple said “they do not currently have green cards” but would not say exactly when they gave up the status, which requires holders to “make the US your permanent home”. The disclosure raises further awkward questions for the chancellor – who said his multimillionaire wife had claimed non-dom status, which allows her to avoid UK tax on her foreign earnings, because she one day intends to return to live in India. Under non-dom rules, Murty does not legally have to pay tax in the UK on the estimated £11.5m in annual dividends she collects from her stake in her billionaire father’s IT business. The non-dom status may have allowed her to avoid up to £20m in UK tax. Murty has said she pays tax on the dividends overseas, but has refused to state how much she pays or in which country. She has previously collected other shareholder income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Holders of green cards are required to pay US tax on their worldwide income – and also to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. They are required to file annual US tax returns, and are “responsible for reporting your income and paying taxes on any foreign earned income”. Read more here: Sadiq Khan has said he is not “going to hide from the fact” he lost confidence in outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick. Speaking at the launch of Labour’s local election campaign in Barnet, north London, the London mayor said: In the recent past, she’s worked with many others to help us reduce violent crime but I’m not going to hide from the fact that I lost confidence in her. I’m not going to hide from the fact that we’ve had in our city a series of devastating scandals, overt racism, sexism, discrimination, homophobia, we’ve had trust and confidence from Londoners in the police service at rock bottom. It’s one of the reasons why I lost confidence in her and it’s one of the things I’ll be looking for in a new commissioner, how they will address some of these serious issues that, frankly speaking, the current commissioner failed to address. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England has increased among those from school year 12 to age 34, and for people aged 70 and over, the ONS said. Infection levels have fallen for children from age two to school year 6 and adults aged from 35 to 49. For all other age groups the trend is “uncertain”. Keir Starmer has said Rishi Sunak and his family will “probably be all right” in the cost of living crisis, following revelations about the chancellor’s wife’s tax-reducing non-domiciled status. Speaking about rising bills for families across the UK at the launch of his party’s local election campaign in Barnet, north London, the Labour leader said: I was going to say every family is going to be paying more, but I think, as we’ve seen in the last few days, I think the Sunaks will probably be all right in this cost of living crisis. At least we’ve solved one mystery that’s been eluding me for the last few days – we now know why the chancellor calls himself a tax-cutting chancellor. About 12,000 people have arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes as of Tuesday, according to Home Office figures. About 10,800 people arrived under the Ukraine family scheme and 1,200 under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, provisional data published on the department’s website shows. A total of 79,800 applications have been received for both schemes and 40,900 visas have been granted as of Thursday. There were 43,600 applications for the sponsorship scheme and 12,500 visas have been issued. Out of 36,300 applications for family visas, 28,500 have been granted. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said she apologised “with frustration” over the time it was taking for Ukrainian refugees to arrive in the UK under visa schemes. But she denied that visa requirements and checks were slowing the process and causing delays, in a pre-recorded interview with the BBC which aired on Friday. Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty were legally declared to be “permanent US residents” – including for tax purposes – for more than a year into his chancellorship, it has been reported. Sky News reports claims that the couple held US “green cards” permitting them residence in the US until more than a year into his chancellorship – before then giving it up during his period at the Treasury. Holders of the green card are required to pay US tax on their worldwide income but are also required to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. Sam Coates of Sky News said: The US government website says the card is only for people who “make the US your permanent home” – which would be odd for someone holding multiple jobs in government, including local government minister, chief secretary to the Treasury and chancellor. A source close to Mr Sunak said “neither of them have green cards”, but refused to answer questions over whether they had them during any of his period as chancellor. Meanwhile, Mr Sunak suggests the ultimate family destination will be India – telling The Sun “that’s where she, you know, ultimately will want to go and look after her parents as they get older”. After marrying in a lavish ceremony in India, the couple actually planned to settle down in California and bought a penthouse flat in Santa Monica, which they still own and use for holidays. The flat, which the couple are reported to be visiting over the Easter holidays, is valued at $7.2m (£5.5m) by US property website Redfin and boasts sweeping views of the world famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific ocean beyond. A union leader is urging the government to press on with its energy strategy, warning that “squabbles” within the Conservative party could kick the plans into the long grass. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said on a visit to the new Hinkley Point nuclear site that the strategy looked like just another “Boris promise”. He was meeting workers on the project, which is creating thousands of jobs, PA Media reports. He said: Nuclear is critical to our energy future and GMB has long told ministers there can be no net zero without new nuclear. But it’s 24 hours since the prime minister was here at Hinkley Point C and the questions over this so-called energy plan won’t go away. Dangling the carrot of a new fleet of reactors may grab headlines today, but without a hard and fast timetable for construction, internal Tory party squabbles could still kick things into the long grass. Offshore wind could provide a huge number of clean energy jobs here at home, but current practice is for UK projects to ship them overseas, leaving the nation open to ransom by despotic regimes. It’s already looking like this plan could be just another Boris promise – here today, gone tomorrow. The government has to get on with it, secure the UK’s energy future and make sure the next generation doesn’t face the same crushing cost of living crisis. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said she apologises “with frustration” over the time it is taking for Ukrainian refugees to arrive in the UK under visa schemes. Around 12,000 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes as of Tuesday, according to Home Office figures. However, she denied that visa requirements and checks are slowing the process and causing delays, in a prerecorded interview with the BBC, which aired on Friday. She told the broadcaster: We are an independent third country and we want to give people the status and security of coming to our country along with the warm welcome. Yes, we want to welcome people, we are welcoming people – over 40,000 visas being granted, over 10,000 people over a space of five weeks coming to the United Kingdom. We have to ensure that they are protected and safeguarded in the United Kingdom as well. The £200 energy bill rebate Rishi Sunak announced last month is a “discount” not a “loan” even though the money will need to be paid back in instalments over five years, starting in 2023. Greg Hands’ explanation didn’t go down too well with the BBC Question Time audience last night, who shouted “It’s a loan!” at the energy minister. Boris Johnson has said it would be “irresponsible” to rule out further lockdowns if more deadly coronavirus variants emerge. The prime minister continued to say he could not rule out the prospect of taking drastic action again as the nation feels the impact of the new Omicron variant, PA Media reports. While symptoms are generally less severe than earlier variants, the rate of Covid-19 hospital admissions in England is the highest since January 2021. Johnson downplayed the chances of having to impose a lockdown again, but said he was holding on to the option in case even more concerning new variants emerge. Speaking to Conservative MPs Esther McVey and Philip Davies for GB News, he said: I want to avoid any such thing ever happening again and I can’t rule out something, I can’t say we wouldn’t be forced to do non-pharmaceutical interventions again of the kind we did. I think it would be irresponsible of any leader in any democracy to say that they’re going to rule out something that can save lives. I believe the things we did saved lives. I’ve got to be absolutely frank with you, there could be a new variant more deadly, there could be a variant that affects children, that we really need to contain, I’m not going to take any options off the table. But I don’t think it will happen. We’re now in the phase where the virus is losing its potency overall and we’ve got a massively vaccinated UK population. Research from the UK Health Security Agency indicates the overall Covid-19 hospital admission rate for England hit 20.5 per 100,000 people in the week ending April 3. That is the fifth successive weekly increase and means total admissions are now at a higher rate than at the peak of the original Omicron wave at the start of January this year, which was 19.9. But the rate is still some way below the all-time high of 36 per 100,000 in the first week of January 2021. Greg Hands said the commentary around Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, is “a little bit unpleasant, to be frank”. Speaking on LBC, he said: As politicians, I think we should stick to the politicians – it’s the politicians who should be scrutinised, not politicians’ families. As it is, Rishi Sunak’s wife has put out a statement yesterday, explaining that she does pay UK tax on her UK income, pays international taxes on her international income; that is not unusual for somebody who is a foreign national. She is an Indian national and her affairs in that regard are not unusual for somebody who is not domiciled here, but is a foreign national. Energy minister Greg Hands has said he is trying to reduce his energy usage in the face of high bills. Speaking on LBC, he said: We totally recognise that energy bills are very, very high for people. It’s driven particularly by the world situation - the appalling Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven global energy prices to record highs. The UK is not immune or exempt from those prices. That is why we are providing some support but, equally, we recognise that these are difficult times for many people with their energy bills. Asked what he is doing to keep his own bills down, Hands said: I’m always trying to keep an eye on my energy consumption, make sure that energy is used sensibly. I’m making sure that I’m not using cars as much as possible, making sure (of) public transport use, all of these things I think all help to reduce energy usage... the way that we lead our lives, I think, is going to be really important. But most of all is the support being provided by government and particularly the energy strategy where, in the medium to long term, we need to produce more of our own energy and more of that energy coming from low-carbon renewable sources and nuclear. The rules around non-dom status “are out of date” and “they do need to be reviewed”, a former minister has said. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee, told Sky News that the debate over the tax status of chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife Akshata Murty was a distraction from the war in Ukraine. He said there was “nothing illegal” about the arrangement, but added: If there are bigger, more fundamental questions about the existence of the non-dom status, that is something for us as a country – perhaps and indeed Parliament – to debate. But the idea that we focus on this discussion about following the rules that actually exist at the moment, I think, is a distraction from what we need to be focusing on, which was the previous subject right now, of what Britain is going to do to help and lead other countries support Ukraine. On the current rules, he added: “In my view, they are out of date, they do need to be reviewed.” The shadow attorney general has said that the chancellor’s wife is “taking advantage” of her decision to claim non-domicile status to avoid paying taxes. Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: In the end, we have somebody who’s been living here for eight years, raising her children here, living at ... Downing Street in accommodation provided by the taxpayer and aspiring to be the wife of the next Prime Minister, and yet she says that she isn’t a permanent resident of this country. She added that the ministerial code mentions that the financial status of ministers’ spouses are relevant because “there can be a conflict of interest”. She said that it is a “complete red herring what passport somebody has”, in reference to the fact that Akshata Murty is an Indian citizen. She added: What’s relevant is that she’s of the 0.1% of the population who have positively chosen to say that although they’re living here, they’re not living here permanently and taking advantage of that decision in order to not pay as much tax. Welcome to today’s politics live blog. I’m Nicola Slawson and I’ll be taking the lead today. You can contact me on Twitter (@Nicola_Slawson) or via email (nicola.slawson@theguardian.com) if you have any questions or think I’m missing something. We also have a dedicated Ukraine blog, which you can follow here: The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has defended his wife after revelations that she claims non-domiciled status, meaning she does not legally have to pay tax in the UK on her income earned abroad. The heiress and businesswoman Akshata Murty, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, is an Indian citizen and is reported to hold a 0.91% stake in Infosys, an IT business founded by her father. Her share is thought to be worth £11.5m a year, meaning she may have avoided up to £20m in UK tax by being non-domiciled in the UK. Murty has said she pays tax overseas. Sunak told the Sun newspaper: “She loves her country like I love mine,” and said his wife had done nothing wrong in choosing a financial arrangement that legally exempts her from paying tax in Britain on foreign income. Asked if he blamed Labour for the “awful” smears against his family, Sunak replied: “yeah”. A report in the Times suggested unnamed allies of the chancellor had claimed the prime minister’s office were behind the leaks – an allegation No 10 and No 11 strongly denied. A Treasury source told the Guardian: It is categorically not true that Rishi or anyone else in his team believe this is coming from No 10. A No 10 spokesperson told PA Media: It is categorically untrue that No 10 is behind the briefings. The prime minister and chancellor are united. Sunak told the Sun newspaper that Murty was entitled to use the so-called “non-dom” arrangement as she was an Indian citizen and planned to move back to her home country to care for her parents. On Wednesday, Murty claimed the non-dom status was given to her automatically as an Indian citizen. But tax experts have said she must choose to seek the status each year. Murty pays £30,000 a year for having non-domiciled status, her spokesperson confirmed. The status will automatically cease once she has resided in Britain for 15 years, with her due to reach that milestone in 2028. Read more here:",

James Jackson, 19, Jaylin White, 19, and Lafayette Whaley, 27, were charged after the incident last February, accused of attempted murder, second-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery in connection with the shooting of Ryan Fischer, who was walking the music artist’s French bulldogs. Jackson was mistakenly freed following an appearance in court on Wednesday, NBC first reported, citing unnamed sources. The charges against Jackson appeared to have been dismissed, but with plans to replace them with a superseding grand jury indictment unsealed at the hearing in Los Angeles, the LA county district attorney’s office told NBC later on Thursday. The outlet further reported that sources with knowledge of the court proceedings noted that it appeared records were not updated about the superseding case. Jackson is the alleged shooter in the incident and is also accused of assault with a semi-automatic firearm and of carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle whilst being a felon. Two French bulldogs belonging to the singer – Koji and Gustav – were stolen in the incident, just a month after Lady Gaga sang the Star-Spangled Banner at Joe Biden’s inauguration at the US Capitol following the insurrection by extremist supporters of Donald Trump there days earlier. A third dog, Miss Asia, managed to evade capture and was recovered by police. Gaga offered a $500,000 reward for the dogs’ safe return but it was reported last month that she hasn’t yet paid the money to a person who returned the snatched pets, on the advice of police who are still investigating the circumstances of the whole episode. Fischer was wounded in the attack.",

The neighborhood lacks basic infrastructure and residents there say they rely on water hauled in from other areas.</p> <p>County officials, including the sheriff, have defended the water measures as an effective tool in a time of historic water shortages, alleging that the subdivision is rife with marijuana cultivation sites that dry up the land.

We target crime. It’s unfortunate that is sort of the card that’s being played,” LaRue told the Guardian at the time.</p> <p>But residents say the county is singling out an entire community in their battle against pot growers, at a disastrous cost. Residents of the subdivision have said without water they were routinely dehydrated, could shower only once a week, struggled with depression and their animals died.</p> <p>Civil rights groups have said the restrictions amount to targeting of the county’s Hmong residents, an effort one attorney called “Jim Crow racism”.</p> <p>Last fall a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-blocks-county-from-cutting-off-water-to-south-asian-immigrants-in-rural-california/#:~:text=Responding%20to%20concerns%20about%20violent,to%20transport%20water%20by%20truck.\">temporarily blocked</a> the county from enforcing the water laws, finding that they have the “practical effect of cutting off the water supply to a minority community that has recently been the target of racial prejudice”. Evidence supported claims that the county’s efforts were intended to force out people in the neighborhood, the judge wrote in a brief.</p> <p>Residents and civil rights organizations say the water restrictions come after years of discrimination against the ethnic minority.</p> <p>Hmong residents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/21/california-drought-hmong-americans-race-water\">told the Guardian</a> last year that when Hmong Americans first started moving to the area in 2015, stores sometimes refused to sell them basic goods, landlords declined to rent to them and neighbors flipped them off as they walked by.</p> <p>Law enforcement painted Hmong Americans as foreigners and criminals, the ACLU argued in its brief to the court, pointing to a 2017 comment from a former sheriff arguing it was “too bad” that the county’s Hmong American residents “didn’t use their ingenuity, intelligence and skills to engage in something lawful”.</p> <p>Last year, the sheriff’s office warned local businesses not to provide services or supplies, including soil, to “known illegal commercial cannabis sites”, and several people who live in Mount Shasta Vista said they were forced to buy water in secret from stores still willing to help them.

          "bodyText": "Law enforcement in a rural northern California county that’s seen a major conflict over water rights stopped Asian drivers at vastly disproportionate rates compared to the county’s white population last year, in what civil rights groups have characterized as a pattern of “intentional discrimination” in the region. The ACLU and the Asian Law Caucus, two civil rights groups, obtained traffic stop data from the Siskiyou county sheriff’s office as part of an investigation into the county’s treatment of its Asian community – particularly Hmong Americans. Siskiyou county, a remote and sprawling swath near the Oregon border, has been locked in a months-long legal battle over extreme water restrictions. Officials have argued the county’s ban on transporting large amounts of water on certain roads is intended to protect groundwater and drive out illegal marijuana grows, which have become a major problem in the county in recent years. But Hmong Americans living in the region say the regulations cut off their access to water amid drought and a destructive fire season and that the rules are part of a broader pattern of discrimination and harassment by officials and law enforcement. The traffic stop records, which were obtained by the ACLU and the Asian Law Caucus, showed that though Asians make up just 2.6% of the population in the county, they accounted for 27.4% of all traffic stops in 2021 in which officials identified the people stopped. The data also shows that that more than 61% of the people the sheriff referred for prosecution for violations of the water ordinance were Asian American. Only 8% were white, though white people comprise 75% of the county’s population. “Based on the records produced by the county, it appears the sheriff rarely ever refers white people to the district attorney for violating the water transportation ordinance or water extraction ordinance,” the groups said in a brief filed with a federal court. John Do, a staff attorney with the ACLU, said his group spoke with dozens of residents of the subdivision who said they were stopped by police without a cause. “It is across the board,” he said. “All the data we’ve examined thus far indicates the targeting of the Asian community and the Hmong community.” The county’s water transportation restrictions are focused on the 1,600-plot Mount Shasta Vista subdivision, where more than 1,000 Hmong Americans live. The neighborhood lacks basic infrastructure and residents there say they rely on water hauled in from other areas. County officials, including the sheriff, have defended the water measures as an effective tool in a time of historic water shortages, alleging that the subdivision is rife with marijuana cultivation sites that dry up the land. The county sheriff, Jeremiah LaRue, told the Guardian in August there are close to 1,700 grows in the community. “We don’t target any people. We target crime. It’s unfortunate that is sort of the card that’s being played,” LaRue told the Guardian at the time. But residents say the county is singling out an entire community in their battle against pot growers, at a disastrous cost. Residents of the subdivision have said without water they were routinely dehydrated, could shower only once a week, struggled with depression and their animals died. Civil rights groups have said the restrictions amount to targeting of the county’s Hmong residents, an effort one attorney called “Jim Crow racism”. Last fall a federal judge temporarily blocked the county from enforcing the water laws, finding that they have the “practical effect of cutting off the water supply to a minority community that has recently been the target of racial prejudice”. Evidence supported claims that the county’s efforts were intended to force out people in the neighborhood, the judge wrote in a brief. Residents and civil rights organizations say the water restrictions come after years of discrimination against the ethnic minority. Hmong residents told the Guardian last year that when Hmong Americans first started moving to the area in 2015, stores sometimes refused to sell them basic goods, landlords declined to rent to them and neighbors flipped them off as they walked by. Law enforcement painted Hmong Americans as foreigners and criminals, the ACLU argued in its brief to the court, pointing to a 2017 comment from a former sheriff arguing it was “too bad” that the county’s Hmong American residents “didn’t use their ingenuity, intelligence and skills to engage in something lawful”. Last year, the sheriff’s office warned local businesses not to provide services or supplies, including soil, to “known illegal commercial cannabis sites”, and several people who live in Mount Shasta Vista said they were forced to buy water in secret from stores still willing to help them. The county sued two ranch owners for allegedly providing water to people in the neighborhood and accused them of selling groundwater to people growing marijuana illegally. “The sheriff don’t care about us. They just want to force us out of here. Even though we’re residents in this county, they still don’t care,” said Cheng Xiong, who lives in the Mount Shasta Vista neighborhood, last summer. The water laws have only further inflamed tensions, residents said. Several told the court last year that other Siskiyou residents have “brandished weapons at them, shot at their cars, stolen their belongings, told them to ‘go back where they came from,’” and threatened to burn down Mount Shasta Vista. Meanwhile, law enforcement has continued to treat Hmong American residents unfairly, said Glenn Katon with the Asian Law Caucus. “The injunction averted the humanitarian crisis that was taking place but the harassment and targeting has continued on a pretty huge scale,” he said. Do, with the ACLU, added that the sheriff office’s statements and actions have had a chilling effect on the community. The sheriff’s office and the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The county has asked the judge to lift the injunction on the water laws, and said it would enforce the laws in the entire county rather than in select areas.",

          "bodyText": "Hello and good morning, Ukraine’s state railway company has said more than 30 people have been killed and more than 100 were wounded after two Russian rockets struck Kramatorsk station in east Ukraine. The Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said thousands of civilians were at the station trying to evacuate to safer areas of Ukraine when it was hit, before an anticipated major offensive. Moscow’s six-week incursion has forced more than 4 million people to flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, turned cities into rubble and led to sweeping sanctions on Russian leaders and companies. In a symbolic move, the United Nations general assembly suspended Russia from the UN human rights council yesterday, expressing “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis”. Russia then quit the council. It came as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, foreshadowed the emergence of more atrocities, saying the situation in the town of Borodianka was “much more disastrous” than in Bucha – where authorities have said hundreds of civilians were found dead. Meanwhile, Germany’s foreign intelligence service has reportedly intercepted radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine. Russia gave the most somber assessment so far of its invasion of Ukraine yesterday, describing the “tragedy” of mounting troop losses and the economic blow from sanctions. “We have significant losses of troops,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News. “It’s a huge tragedy for us.” What’s going on in Mariupol? More than 100,000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged southern port city. Pro-Russian authorities said about 5,000 people had been killed and 60-70% of the housing stock at least partially destroyed. What’s the situation in Kyiv? Russian forces have pulled back from around the Ukrainian capital in recent days and are believed to be regrouping to focus on conquering the Donbas in the east. Lithuania’s ambassador to Ukraine returned to the capital yesterday, becoming one of the few diplomats to return. What happened in Dmytrivka? Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appeared to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside the village west of Kyiv in a video posted online, a potential war crime. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily, and is shot multiple times. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation as first Black woman on supreme court lauded as ray of hope Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal appeals court judge, was confirmed to the supreme court yesterday, overcoming a rancorous Senate approval process and earning bipartisan approval to become the first Black woman to serve as a justice on the high court. Responding to her confirmation, politicians and activists kept coming back to one word: “joy”. “I feel immense pride and so much joy at this historic occasion,” said Senator Cory Booker. It’s a “historic moment for our nation”, said President Joe Biden. Jackson, who serves on the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, will replace Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intended to retire this summer. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court. But it does mean for the first time in the court’s history that white men are in the minority. Why is her confirmation so historic? In the supreme court’s more than 200-year history a Black woman has never before served as a justice. What was the Senate voting tally? 53 to 47, with all Democrats in favor. They were joined by three moderate Republicans, senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. What does it mean for the court’s ideological balance? The supreme court will still be bent 6-3 towards conservatives over liberals. Capitol attack investigators zero in on far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack appears to believe it included a coordinated assault perpetrated by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups that sought to physically stop the certification of Biden’s election victory. The panel’s working theory crystallized this week after obtaining evidence of the coordination in testimony and non-public video, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The panel has amassed deep evidence about the connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys in recent weeks after it obtained hours of footage of the leaders of the militia groups in Washington before the Capitol attack, the sources said. Most crucially for the panel, the new information forms part of the evidence to connect the militia groups that stormed the Capitol on 6 January to the organizers of the Save America rally that immediately preceded the attack – who in turn are slowly being linked to the Trump White House. In other news … The Syrian government has seized more than $1.5bn worth of personal property – including cars, olive groves, shops, houses, electronics and jewellery – from citizens accused of joining anti-government protests, according to a rights group. The seizures have been condemned as “akin to a revenge or scare tactic”. US authorities arrested a yakuza leader on charges of plotting to distribute heroin and methamphetamine in the US and purchase weapons – including US-made missiles – for rebels in Myanmar. New York prosecutors said Takeshi Ebisawa was a leader of the Japanese crime syndicate. Akshata Murty, the UK chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife, has potentially avoided up to £20m ($26m) in UK tax by being technically non-domiciled despite living in Downing Street. Yesterday’s reports pile further pressure on the couple. Murty gets about £11.5m a year in dividends from a stake in an Indian IT firm. The Omicron Covid variant causes different symptoms from Delta, a study published in the Lancet has found. The Omicron wave was linked to an average 6.9 days of symptoms, compared with 8.9 when Delta dominated, with fewer people losing their sense of smell and more experiencing a sore throat. Abu Dhabi appears to have facilitated payments to Manchester City soccer club, according to emails published by Der Spiegel. The reporting has reignited the controversy that led to the club in 2020 receiving a ban from the European Champions League that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. Stat of the day: San Francisco spent $312m of Covid funds on police, 49% of its 2020 Arpa aid Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, public records show. Money from both Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa) and Trump’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act flowed to the police. Los Angeles spent roughly 50% of its first round of Arpa relief funds on the LAPD. Fresno spent $36.6m of its Cares funds on the police, making up 67% of Cares spending on city salaries. San Jose allocated about $27.8m of its Cares and Arpa funds to the police. Don’t miss this … Fantastic Beasts and where to cancel them: how the Wizarding World lost its magic Lost revenue, accusations of hate speech, the previously unimaginable spectacle of Vladimir Putin declaring that he knows how JK Rowling feels: what a volatile climate to release the latest Harry Potter spin-off movie, writes Ryan Gillbey. But how did the franchise lose its magic? The most deleterious effect on the Wizarding World has been caused not so much by lacklustre product – Fantastic Beasts still has fans in abundance – but by Rowling herself. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Eddie Redmayne have all distanced themselves publicly from the Harry Potter author and declared their solidarity with trans people. The future of Fantastic Beasts is uncertain. Climate check: how rising sea levels are causing a US migration crisis About 15 million American homes are at risk of flooding and sea levels are rising. The US is experiencing a migration crisis, Max Ufberg writes in a powerful dispatch on the people affected, and yet even after a deluge of warnings there is no centralized lifeline for coastal communities. Mendoza, a 35-year-old mother of three, was forced to move from the flood-prone area where she grew up and where most of her family resides. “This was mine,” she tells Ufberg, returning to her vandalized former home. “I had my bed here. My makeup vanity here.” Last Thing … Experience: my scream is famous You have heard my scream in Free Guy, Paranormal Activity and Scream (2022), says Ashley Peldon.

She amply displayed all of these phenomena throughout three grueling days of questioning,” <strong><a href=\"https://law.richmond.edu/faculty/ctobias/\">Carl Tobias</a></strong>, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond said.</p> \n  <p>“Her confirmation will enhance the supreme court and the nation in many critical ways. Of course, her appointment is historic, as she is the first Black woman to serve, she will improve court diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, ideology and experience. </p> \n  <p>“Jackson [also] promises to be a mainstream justice, which is important, because the Court is more ideologically conservative than it has been in the last 80 years and may not reflect the will of the people. Her diverse experiences are also critical, as Justice Sotomayor is the only justice who served as a district judge and no present justice has engaged in criminal defense work, which Jackson did and which improves her decision making.”</p> \n  <p>Professor Tobias added he was hopeful Jackson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/ketanji-brown-jackson-republicans-senate-confirmation-hearing\">torrid confirmation process</a> would lead to improvements in how future supreme court justices are seated.</p> \n  <p>“Many Americans, including members of the judiciary committee, believe that the confirmation process has been deteriorating. The process has become overly politicized and partisan and senators asked Jackson too many questions that lacked relevance, seemed calculated to score political points ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, or were even improper or insulting. </p> \n  <p>“I am cautiously optimistic that committee members and other senators will work on improvements in the process, which now can reflect poorly on the committee, the Senate, and the president and may erode public confidence in all three branches of federal government, but especially the court.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-624f32ad8f0887d7b40d5f8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-04-07T18:53:46.439Z\">7.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>ABC News has tweeted an image of Ketanji Brown Jackson hugging with President Joe Biden, taken at the White House at the moment her supreme court confirmation vote passed the majority threshold.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1512134341257830403\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pres.

Essentially, Judge Ketanji Brown’s lifetime appointment to the bench will be confirmed by a simple majority vote of the 100 US senators in the chamber this afternoon.</strong></p> \n  <p>The US Senate is currently evenly split, between <strong>50 Republicans</strong>, and the <strong>48 Democrats</strong> and <strong>two independents</strong> who usually vote with them. In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate confirmation vote, the Democratic vice-president <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> would be called upon to break the tie and promote Jackson to the supreme court.</p> \n  <p>Three Republicans, however, and two at least two moderate Democrats whose votes might have been in the balance, have publicly declared their support for Jackson. </p> \n  <p>So, even if there are no more defections, Harris’s intervention will not be necessary, and the vote for Jackson would be at least 53-47 in her favor. That’s the same margin that senators voted in the last hour to end discussion on Jackson’s nomination and advance the process to the final Senate floor vote.</p> \n  <p>Assuming she is confirmed, Jackson will be seated later this summer, when the liberal justice <strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>, whose retirement led to <strong>Joe Biden</strong> nominating Jackson for his seat, stands down after 22 years’ service.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-04-07T17:18:57.635Z\">at 6.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-624f0fa08f083703c7bd7d02\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-04-07T16:33:30.637Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senate clears Jackson confirmation for final vote</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Supreme court: key preliminary vote passes to limit debate in Senate </strong></p> \n  <p>The Senate has now voted 53 to 47 to limit debate on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court.

          "bodyText": "We’re closing down the blog now after a day dominated by the historic confirmation by the US Senate of the first Black judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to a seat on the US supreme court. Please join us again tomorrow, when Joe Biden will talk about Jackson’s confirmation from the White House, and for what will surely be another busy day in US politics. Remember you can continue to follow developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our live blog here. Here’s where else our day went: The New York attorney general Letitia James filed for a contempt order against Donald Trump for his refusal to cooperate with her inquiry into his business dealings. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had tested positive for Covid-19. The justice department blocked the House 6 January inquiry from accessing 15 boxes of Trump’s White House records, according to reports. One other issue to emerge from this afternoon’s White House press briefing: the Biden administration dismissed as “a publicity stunt” a declaration by the Texas governor Greg Abbott that he was going to bus undocumented migrants to Washington DC. Abbott floated the plan as his response to the upcoming termination of Title 42, a Trump-era immigration policy blocking migrants at the US southern border because of Covid-19. Critics of the administration, and the homeland security department, predict a surge of migrants when the program ends next month. “I’m not aware of any authority the governor would be doing that under,” Psaki said. “I think it’s pretty clear this is a publicity stunt, his own office admits that a migrant would need to voluntarily be transported and he can’t compel them to because enforcement of our country’s immigration government lies with the federal government, not a state.” Inevitably, questions in the White House briefing room turned to Covid-19 and the announcement earlier today that the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was twice in Joe Biden’s close company without a mask in recent days, had tested positive. Psaki said the administration was not concerned for the 79-year-old president’s age because, under centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) guidelines, the two are not considered “close contacts.” “It’s not arbitrary. It’s not something made up by the White House,” Psaki said of the guidelines. “They define it as being within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes over a 24 hour period that they were not. “In terms of additional testing or anything along those lines, those assessments would be made by the president’s doctor. He was tested last evening and tested negative. “We have incredibly stringent protocols at the White House that we keep in place to keep the president, to keep everybody safe. Those go over and above CDC guidelines, and that includes ensuring that anyone who is going to be around the president is tested.” Over at the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki has been answering questions about US arms shipments to Ukraine, given military leaders’ assessments that the war against Russia could take years. “There are transfers of systems nearly every single day,” Psaki said, hours after the Ukraine defense minister Dymtro Zulebi told journalists in Brussels that there were only three items on his country’s wish list for the US and its allies: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” “For every Russian tank in Ukraine, the United States will have, or has provided, 10 anti-tank systems. For every Russian armored vehicle in Ukraine, the United States will have provided about three anti-armor systems, if you factor in contributions from allies,” Psaki said. “The way this works is that the Ukrainian leaders request a range of assistance, they often provide us lists, we go through that list, we determine what we can provide. We provide a vast, vast majority of what they’re requesting [and] if we don’t have access to it, sometimes it’s Russian-made military equipment, we work with our allies and partners to see what they can provide.” Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. Read more here: Vice-president Kamala Harris, who oversaw the senate vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson, said she was “overjoyed” at the result. “I am feeling overjoyed and I am feeling a deep sense of pride in who we are as a nation,” Harris told reporters as she was leaving the chamber, according to NPR. The White House has announced that Harris will join President Joe Biden for a press conference on the South Lawn tomorrow at 12.15pm to talk about Jackson’s confirmation. Supreme court scholars are weighing in with analysis on the Jackson confirmation, calling her a “worthy successor” to the retiring liberal justice Stephen Breyer. “She possesses all of the attributes that the US expects of supreme court justices, she has substantial relevant experience as a judge at the district and appellate levels of the federal judiciary, is highly intelligent, diligent and independent, and enjoys balanced judicial temperament. She amply displayed all of these phenomena throughout three grueling days of questioning,” Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond said. “Her confirmation will enhance the supreme court and the nation in many critical ways. Of course, her appointment is historic, as she is the first Black woman to serve, she will improve court diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, ideology and experience. “Jackson [also] promises to be a mainstream justice, which is important, because the Court is more ideologically conservative than it has been in the last 80 years and may not reflect the will of the people. Her diverse experiences are also critical, as Justice Sotomayor is the only justice who served as a district judge and no present justice has engaged in criminal defense work, which Jackson did and which improves her decision making.” Professor Tobias added he was hopeful Jackson’s torrid confirmation process would lead to improvements in how future supreme court justices are seated. “Many Americans, including members of the judiciary committee, believe that the confirmation process has been deteriorating. The process has become overly politicized and partisan and senators asked Jackson too many questions that lacked relevance, seemed calculated to score political points ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, or were even improper or insulting. “I am cautiously optimistic that committee members and other senators will work on improvements in the process, which now can reflect poorly on the committee, the Senate, and the president and may erode public confidence in all three branches of federal government, but especially the court.” ABC News has tweeted an image of Ketanji Brown Jackson hugging with President Joe Biden, taken at the White House at the moment her supreme court confirmation vote passed the majority threshold. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation represents “a tremendously historic day at the White House and in the country,” according to Joe Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki. Speaking at her afternoon press briefing, Psaki said Biden had remained engaged through the entire confirmation process, talking with senators on both sides of the political divide. “This is a fulfillment of a promise the president made to the country. His time on the judiciary committee was defining for him and gave him historically exceptional preparation for what we would consider a smooth process, characterized by heavy engagement with both parties in the senate,” Psaki said. “He promised to choose a successor in the mold of Justice [Stephen] Breyer as Republicans and Democrats called for and after thorough consideration chose Judge Jackson, or Justice Jackson I guess we can now call her. “The President’s outreach continued at this stage, calling senators in both parties early about his choice. Out of the gate, he proved he had chosen someone in the tradition by immediately getting endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and Judge Thomas Griffith [Biden’s appointee to the presidential commission on the supreme court], followed by procession of leading conservative legal minds and additional law enforcement organizations.” In Ketanji Brown Jackson, “President Biden picked the most extraordinary individual that I could think of in America,” the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee, Dick Durbin, has said. “She turned out to be a pillar of strength to show grace and dignity and really won over the hearts of the American people,” he told reporters after the confirmation vote. “We want to make our justice system look much more like America. And today we took a giant step forward in giving this judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, her lifetime chance to serve on the United States supreme court.” The president of the national association for the advancement of colored people (NAACP) Derrick Johnson has welcomed Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the supreme court. “In 2022, the first Black woman will finally sit on America’s supreme court. It has taken far too long, but President Biden promised and delivered,” he said in a statement. “Former NAACP Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall broke down the wall when he was nominated and confirmed as the first Black American to sit on the Supreme Court. Today, Ketanji Brown Jackson shattered the glass ceiling. “While history has been made today, the unjust hurdles Black women like Ketanji Brown Jackson face each and every day were centerstage throughout the hearing process. The racist attacks were disgusting and shameful, but, as Black women do, Ketanji Brown Jackson outshined the hate. Today and every day, we celebrate Black women. “The NAACP remains committed to tearing down the racist obstacles that continue to obstruct paths for far too many Americans, especially Black women, throughout our nation. While we celebrate today, tomorrow we are back at work tackling student debt, voting and reproductive rights, climate change, and police reform, so that everyone in America can realize their dream.” Finally, Rand Paul, unsurprisingly, makes his vote a no, making Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic confirmation vote final at 53-47. “On this vote the yays are 53, the nays are 47, and this nomination is confirmed,” the vice-president Kamala Harris, said, acting in her role of Senate president. The chamber immediately erupted into cheers. The final vote tally for Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation is not yet in. The Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul is, for reasons that are still unclear, yet to cast his vote. Regardless, Jackson’s confirmation is a done deal, with the tally standing at 53-46 in her favor. She will be sworn in sometime in late June or early July, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whom she is replacing, retires from the bench. The US Senate has voted to confirm Joe Biden’s pick Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat on the US supreme court. The historic vote makes her the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court. Full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer is giving his closing remarks ahead of the chamber’s vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court confirmation. “This is a wonderful day, a joyous day and an inspiring day for the Senate, the supreme court, and the United States of America,” he said. “It’s been a dark two years with Covid... but even in the darkest times there are bright lights. Today is one of the brightest lights. Let us hope it is a metaphor, an indication of many more bright lights. “Every step of her upbringing and career, Ketanji Brown Jackson ranked one of the highest achievers.” She will, he said, “enhance the court’s ability to preserve the basic truth in our country that all deserve equal justice under the law, from the privilege to the impoverished.” Schumer acknowledged that Jackson will become the first Black woman to sit on the panel. “This judge belongs on the supreme court. By that I mean something very specific. In our nation’s history, 115 individuals have been confirmed by this body to serve on the supreme court. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first African American woman ever to hold the title. The kids will open textbooks and see pictures of Justice Jackson among the highest ranks.” New York’s attorney general Letitia James has asked a state judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court for refusing to turn over documents she subpoenaed for her civil investigation into the former US president’s business operations. In the court filing, James said Trump failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply “in full” with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. James is seeking that Trump be fined $10,000 a day until he complies. Last week, James asked the appeals court to uphold a lower-court ruling requiring Trump to answer questions under oath, after a civil investigation uncovered evidence he may have misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on financial statements for more than a decade. “The evidence collected to date suggests that financial statements, tax submissions, loan guarantees, and other documents contain material misstatements and omissions,” James’s office said in court papers. James is also seeking to uphold a ruling forcing Trump’s two oldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr, to testify. Both have been executives at the Trump Organization. Here’s a handy explainer, courtesy of CNN, about how the supreme court confirmation process works. Essentially, Judge Ketanji Brown’s lifetime appointment to the bench will be confirmed by a simple majority vote of the 100 US senators in the chamber this afternoon. The US Senate is currently evenly split, between 50 Republicans, and the 48 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with them. In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate confirmation vote, the Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris would be called upon to break the tie and promote Jackson to the supreme court. Three Republicans, however, and two at least two moderate Democrats whose votes might have been in the balance, have publicly declared their support for Jackson. So, even if there are no more defections, Harris’s intervention will not be necessary, and the vote for Jackson would be at least 53-47 in her favor. That’s the same margin that senators voted in the last hour to end discussion on Jackson’s nomination and advance the process to the final Senate floor vote. Assuming she is confirmed, Jackson will be seated later this summer, when the liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement led to Joe Biden nominating Jackson for his seat, stands down after 22 years’ service. Supreme court: key preliminary vote passes to limit debate in Senate The Senate has now voted 53 to 47 to limit debate on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court. The cloture vote is a key part of the process with the final confirmation vote expected later Thursday in the early afternoon in Washington DC. “No one can argue that Justice Brown Jackson is not qualified to be confirmed,” said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, in the chamber just after the vote. “Judge Jackson has earned the president’s nomination, and has earned confirmation from the Senate.” He criticized the way Republicans conducted themselves in the nomination hearings. Shortly earlier he tweeted that it was a day to “make history”. She left it late, but the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat, has just announced she will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court. News of Sinema’s potential vote has been closely watched. Along with fellow moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the two have combined to derail several of Joe Biden’s policy goals in the US Senate this term. Manchin declared his intention to support Jackson last week, and with at least three Republicans on board, Sinema’s vote was not in the end crucial - although it would have been a surprise for her to have voted no. A cloture vote to end Senate debate on Jackson’s nomination is due imminently, and the final confirmation vote is scheduled for about 1.45pm. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi has tested positive for Covid-19, her office has just announced. A statement from the Speaker’s spokesperson Drew Hammill reads: After testing negative this week, Speaker Pelosi received a positive test result for Covid-19 and is currently asymptomatic. The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided. The Speaker will quarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly.” Pelosi, 82, was with president Joe Biden, and the former president Barack Obama, at the White House on Tuesday as he signed an executive order extending the affordable care act. Few of the attendees were masked. She was with Biden again yesterday at the White House when the president signed the postal services act. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki is certain to be asked about it at her lunchtime briefing today. Obama has recently recovered from Covid-19. Pelosi was not an attendee at the Gridiron dinner in Washington DC on Saturday, following which several Biden administration officials tested positive, including the US attorney general Merrick Garland and commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, as well as Democratic congressmen Adam Schiff and Joaquin Castro. The justice department is blocking the 6 January House investigation from accessing more than a dozen boxes of records from the Trump White House, CNN is reporting, fueling speculation they are the subject of its own criminal inquiry. According to the network, National Archives general counsel Gary Stern wrote to the House oversight committee saying it was unable to respond to a request for information from the panel about the records based on the Archives’ “consultation” with the justice department. The bipartisan panel is looking into Trump’s efforts to overturn his election defeat, including his incitement of the deadly 6 January Capitol attack. The 15 boxes of records in question are those Trump is said to have taken with him to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, in January 2021 when he left office, in apparent violation of federal records laws. The development is a bump for the House panel, which has made significant headway in recent weeks as it attempts to establish Trump’s culpability. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, both former White House advisers, have given testimony in the past few days. The justice department, and the US attorney general Merrick Garland, have come under fire for perceived slow progress in its own inquiry. CNN said the justice department had declined to comment, but that it was common practice to limit information that government agencies share with Congress while an investigation is ongoing. On Wednesday, the House voted to hold former Trump advisers Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt for refusing subpoenas to testify to the panel.

The conversions are “a warning sign” for Democrats as they attempt to keep control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, the Reuters report states. Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state that backed Joe Biden narrowly in 2020, is likely to see a furious scramble for one of its Senate seats with the retirement of Pat Toomey, the only statewide elected Republican. “I just got fed up and just felt like there has to be a better way,” Beth Jones, 48, a retired Philadelphia police officer who last month registered as a Republican, told Reuters, citing crime and high inflation for her decision. Jones said she had voted Democratic for three decades. Reuters said it examined registration data in six states that could see tight US Senate races in November and which generally require voters to be members of a party to participate in nominating contests. While each state tracks voter registration differently, the review pointed to Republican gains in four of those states, and no substantial difference in two of them. In Pennsylvania, Republicans have converted four Democrats for every Republican who has switched the other way, according to the Pennsylvania’s state department data. The conversion rate is well above 2016, Reuters says, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. A bipartisan group of senators wants Joe Biden to reverse the decision to end the Trump-era immigration policy that blocked refugees at the US southern border because of the coronavirus pandemic. Axios is reporting that the group of five Democratic and six Republican senators will introduce a bill later today that would prevent the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 without a detailed plan in place to stop an expected surge of migrants at the border. “It is evident that the current preparations and plans for the end of Title 42 aren’t adequate,” Axios quoted the bill’s co-sponsor, the Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, stating she met with the homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. The Biden administration announced last week that the policy introduced by Trump in 2020 would end on 23 May, painting it as a public health move because the pandemic was easing. But the announcement has received massive pushback, and threatens to derail negotiations in Congress over a relief package for vaccines, treatments and testing, the Washington Post reported. The White House wanted $22.5bn, and a bipartisan panel of senators appeared to have settled on $10bn, before the Title 42 prompted a furious reaction from Republicans. Adding to the acrimony, the Texas governor Greg Abbott says he’s going to round up busloads of undocumented immigrants and send them to Washington DC for Joe Biden to deal with, according to CNN. Read about the impact of the Title 42 decision here: Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, a review of public records has revealed, with several cities prioritizing police funding by a wide margin. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), the Biden administration’s signature stimulus package, the US government sent funds to cities to help them fight coronavirus and support local recovery efforts. The money, officials said, could be used to fund a range of services, including public health and housing initiatives, healthcare workers’ salaries, infrastructure investments and aid for small businesses. But most large California cities spent millions of Arpa dollars on law enforcement. Some also gave police money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act, adopted in 2020 under Donald Trump. In a state with severe income inequality and a dramatically worsening homelessness crisis, the stimulus spending has sparked backlash from community organizers who argue that the funds should have gone directly to civilians and that police should have accepted cuts. “It was called the ‘American Rescue Plan’, but you’re telling me that what needed to be rescued was the police department?” said Stephen “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor and activist at Skid Row in LA. “The city’s kneejerk reaction is always to use law enforcement to respond to everything … and the police forces keep getting larger.” Read the full story here: The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled a 1.45pm vote for the confirmation of Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson to be confirmed as the first Black female associate justice of the US Supreme Court. In a tweet, Schumer said: “It will be a joyous day for America!” Despite a fractious and sometimes farcical hearing in the House two weeks ago, and the announcement of high-profile Republican senator Lindsey Graham that he wouldn’t support her now (despite voting for her earlier elevation to the US appeals court), her confirmation is all but certain. Three Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have announced they will vote for her, assuring Biden of a prized bipartisan appointment in the equally divided chamber. Jackson’s elevation to the nation’s highest court, replacing the long-serving liberal justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring, is more than just symbolic. The lifetime appointment at the age of 51 could see Jackson on the bench for decades, and she will likely prove a vocal counter to the panel’s current 6-3 conservative majority. The Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate judiciary, praised Jackson’s “impeccable qualifications” on Monday, and said her experience as a public defender would bring a “missing perspective to the court”. “Hers is a uniquely American family story, how much hope and promise can be achieved in just one generation,” Durbin said. “I’m proud we can bear witness to it.” Jackson will become only the sixth woman to sit on the Supreme Court in its more than 200-year history. Read the highlights of Jackson’s confirmation hearings here: Good morning blog readers, and welcome to what will be a busy Thursday. It’s a big day at the US supreme court, where Joe Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is almost certain to be confirmed as its newest associate justice in a Senate vote scheduled for 1.45pm.

Covid-19 numbers are rising again in many states as the BA.2 variant takes hold and wrangling continues in Congress over the size of a financial support package.

The Indian heiress, and her husband, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, own a property portfolio of four homes worth an estimated £15m – including an LA penthouse overlooking the beach where Baywatch was filmed. The couple, who married in a lavish two-day Indian ceremony in 2009 and have two children, live predominantly in a flat above 10 Downing Street but also own two other properties in the capital and a £2m Grade II-listed Georgian mansion in Yorkshire. Murty, 42, is sitting on an estimated £690m fortune held in shares in Infosys, the IT giant founded by her billionaire father. That makes her much richer than the Queen, who has about £365m. It was revealed this week that despite living in the UK for the past nine years, Murty claims non-domicile status, allowing her to avoid paying UK tax on the £11.5m-a-year she collects in dividend from the overseas IT fortune. Using the “non-dom” scheme – which is also used by the now-sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and the Daily Mail owner, Lord Rothermere – has allowed Murty to not pay up an estimated £20m in tax that would have been due on £54m of dividends earned over the past seven-and-a-half years if she decided to pay UK tax in full.

In the picturesque North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston, the couple own a Grade II-listed Georgian manor house estimated to be worth £2m. The house, which they bought for £1.5m before Sunak became MP for the Richmond (Yorks) constituency, is undergoing a £250,000 development to add an indoor swimming pool, hot tub, tennis club and gym complex. Both Murty and Sunak are fitness fanatics, who have spoken of dawn workouts before work every day. The couple were last year granted planning permission for a single storey L-shaped building in a paddock beside the lake at their Yorkshire home set in 12 acres near Northallerton. The building project includes a 40ft by 16ft indoor pool, changing area, hot tub and dance room with a mirrored wall. The building is to be clad with local stone and topped with a Welsh slate roof to make it appear like “a stone-built ancillary building that has undergone renovation and modification”. However at the planning meeting last year, the councillor John Noone said: “It doesn’t look like an agricultural building to me, it looks like a rather large bungalow. I think it does actually have an impact on the setting of the Grade II manor house. When we went on the site visit you could clearly see the manor house from where we were stood.” In California, where Murty and Sunak met, she owns a $7.2m (£5.5m) penthouse apartment that boasts sweeping views of the world-famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific Ocean beyond. Estate agents for the six-storey building, built in 2013, boast that the penthouse comes with “large private outdoor terraces unlike anything ever seen before on Ocean Avenue”. Residents of the Waverly complex on Ocean Avenue are promised “the epitome of urban Santa Monica beach living” with “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountain”, where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”. The building, designed by KTGY architects and with interiors by the LA designers Marmol Radziner, offers an around-the-clock concierge and a fitness centre “stocked with the latest equipment for those looking to improve their cardiovascular or muscular endurance”. There is even a “pet spa” where residents’ “furry companions can get pampered”. Murty, who was born in India, spent most of her late-teens and 20s in LA. She went to the city’s private liberal Claremont McKenna College, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys, said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – I understood why you let your heart be stolen.” As well as the Infosys stake, the couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has held direct stakes in at least six other UK companies, including the gentlemen’s outfitters New &amp; Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murtyhas also held shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and the gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New &amp; Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm.",
